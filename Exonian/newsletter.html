In the past, political figures have not been able to say certain phrases such as radical Islamic terrorism or in the case of Paul Ryan, “Donald Trump.” This inability has never applied to me until last night. On election night, I had this unique experience of physically being unable to say two words: “President Trump.” Now Trump supporters may laugh this off as my being a crazy liberal, but the fact of the matter is that I, a heterosexual white male, have never been more scared and shocked in my life. Last night, a large chunk of my dorm watched CNN’s election coverage for several hours, most of them being Clinton supporters. The boys waiting for the election results with me were and are some of the strongest, finest people I have ever met in... <a href="https://theexonian.com/2016/11/10/president-trump/">Read more</a>
