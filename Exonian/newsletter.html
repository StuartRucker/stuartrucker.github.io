The proposal states that if over half of the student body signs a petition requesting to have a certain issue be put to a vote, or the majority of StuCo votes in favor of having a campus-wide referendum on some issue, a referendum will be held. Whatever policy being proposed through the referendum would then pass if a majority of the student body votes in favor, with a voter turnout rate of over 50 percent. In addition, the proposal allows the student body to recall any elected official by earning over two-thirds of the vote in a recall referendum, which can be triggered through a petition signed by over two-thirds of students. The particulars of this plan were discussed by council members throughout the meeting.</span></p>

Padding resumes promotes this notion that actions such as going to Third World countries and snapping a few pictures with the natives should make a huge splash even if there’s no meaningful follow-up or insight from that adventure.
