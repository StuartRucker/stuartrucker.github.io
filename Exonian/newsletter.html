To this end, the editors have worked with the paper’s advisers and members of the administration to address questions of whether the public’s right to know certain information outweighs the potential damage it could cause. The Executive Board is also in the process of developing a set of guidelines for its relationship with the administration in a way that preserves <i>The Exonian</i>’s mission of free press.</span></p>

Although I wasn’t particularly fond of the print itself, the idea it embodied was tantalizing. To be granted the kilt would mean that I made it through the difficult transition and awkward fumbling of prep year, the more difficult workload of lower year, the infamous workload of the 333 history sequence and upper spring and the horrors of senior fall. It would serve as a mark of camaraderie between me and my fellow four-years and symbolize the unique experience we’d all shared after spending nearly a quarter of our lives together. It disappoints me that members of our community would want to strip four-years of this beloved tradition.

Boys’ and girls’ cross country and soccer rescheduled their Saturday events as well as girls’ field hockey and volleyball. Unlike last year’s PSAT, which was scheduled on a no-class Wednesday, the school could only administer the test at Exeter High School last Saturday. Although the teams were given accommodations in the form of an earlier testing hour, many students felt that their potential success in both academic and athletic performance that day were hindered by the fatigue presented by the intense PSAT schedule.</span></p>
