Exeter fought hard, edging its opponent out in the first two sets, but unfortunately lost the close game in the fifth set. This loss lowered its record to 6-4.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Exeter remained positive throughout the game, which showed in the first two sets. Its composure, however, faded as the game went on. Senior and co-captain Rachel Luo commented on the team\u2019s energy. \u201cOur biggest struggle with away games is coming off the bus fresh and being ready to play, and that wasn\u2019t an issue this weekend,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the third set the momentum shifted. Upper Molly O\u2019Day said that after the first two sets, they had become overconfident. \u201cOnce we started losing by even a few points, there was a mood change on the court and we started to play to not lose rather than to win,\u201d she said. After the second set, Exeter didn\u2019t maintain the high sense of energy and mental readiness they displayed in the prior two sets, which ultimately let them down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Technically speaking, Exeter had a strong showing. \u201cOur liberos were passing amazingly. We had a strong outside hit so we just set them a lot. But we were also able to change the flow and set other hitters when St. Paul\u2019s figured us out,\u201d O\u2019Day said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><br \/>\nGoing forward, Exeter aims to continue playing with high energy and to improve their composure. \u201cAs a team, we can use this game to remember that we can\u2019t let up until after the ref\u2019s whistle on that very last point,\u201d Luo said. Staying focused and being mentally prepared to play every point will be essential to Big Red\u2019s success moving forward.Luo echoed O\u2019Day, reiterating that it wasn\u2019t necessarily a lack of skill that caused the loss. \u201cPassing and hitting stats were fairly decent, but we just didn\u2019t quite have the same spirit in the last three sets,\u201d Luo elaborated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">&#8220;I absolutely believe in this team and that if everyone does their job, we can advance in the finals and win another championship.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Next Saturday, Exeter will play at home against NMH. If Big Red shows its mental toughness and maintain a high level of play in general, the girls will find success. \u201cI absolutely believe in this team and that if everyone does their job, we can advance in the finals and win another championship,&#8221; O\u2019Day said, optimistic of her teammates\u2019 collective ability. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Girls\u2019 volleyball played away against St. Paul\u2019s last Saturday.

of Browning House Still in Limbo","title_plain":"Renaming of Browning House Still in Limbo","content":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Although the Academy decided last April that Browning House would be renamed, a new name has yet to be announced. The trustees decided to rename Browning House following a request filed by Louis N. Browning \u201850 asking to remove his family\u2019s name from the dormitory.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>While a sign bearing the name \u201cBrowning House\u201d was removed from the building earlier this term, members of the administration contacted by <i>The Exonian<\/i> were unaware of any plans in place to determine the new name. The name \u201cBrowning House\u201d or \u201cBrowning\u201d is still used for all official purposes, including on Exeter Connect and on the school website.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In January of 2016, Browning wrote a letter to President of Trustees Eunice Panetta \u201984, asking that his family\u2019s name be removed from the dormitory, as he felt that the views of the school no longer aligned with his. He specifically objected to the lack of students from the Appalachians and Rocky Mountains, and Exeter\u2019s acceptance of \u201csame-gender marriage and homosexual coupling.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cThe decision is, thus, not the trustees\u2019 decision to make; it is Mr. Browning\u2019s.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">After discussing the issue, the trustees decided that Browning had the right to have his name removed from the dormitory. In an interview last April with <i>The Exonian<\/i> Panetta said, \u201cThe decision is, thus, not the trustees\u2019 decision to make; it is Mr. Browning\u2019s.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When asked about the status of the Browning name change as of this fall, Panetta said that any decisions on the topic were in the hands of the administration, which does not appear to have taken any actions to date. Attempts to contact Dean of Residential Life AJ Cosgrove, Dean of Faculty Ethan Shapiro, who also serves as a dorm faculty in Browning House, and Assistant Principal Ronald Kim, however, did not yield any additional information on the matter. Each stated that they were uninvolved in any discussions surrounding the Browning name change. Principal Lisa MacFarlane did not respond to a request for an interview by the time <i>The Exonian<\/i> went to press on Wednesday evening. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There has been no prior incident of a name removal by request of an Alumnus\/a in the past, so there is little precedent for administrators to follow in changing the name. However, student and faculty residents of Browning, unaware of any plans set in place to rename their dormitory, seemed impatient for information on the change. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Prep Thomas Wang felt that since his arrival in the fall, the name of his dormitory has been a source of confusion. He said that he and other dorm members would like a greater degree of transparency as the name-changing process continues. \u201c[Administrators] haven\u2019t really kept us informed, and they just took down the sign down one day, without telling us beforehand,\u201d he said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Browning House faculty member and mathematics instructor David Huoppi acknowledged that neither he nor any other faculty affiliates have received additional information on the name\u2019s removal or change. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Upper Julian Perez agreed with Wang. He said he found it strange that there has been no conversation between members of the dormitory and the administration on the planned name change. \u201cI think that it\u2019s weird that the school hasn\u2019t updated us on anything. Most of the guys in the dorm are confused because nothing has happened yet,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Wang was frustrated by this lack of clarity. He said he believes that the residents of Browning are entitled to inclusion in the renaming process. \u201cIt\u2019s so unfair that they keep us, the residents of Browning, outside of the loop,\u201d he said<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Although frustrated by the lack of transparency surrounding the name change, some members of the dorm feel that the renaming itself will have little effect on the dorm\u2019s identity and culture. \u201cIt\u2019s annoying, but I don\u2019t think them removing the sign is going to have any impact on how we refer to ourselves. Until the school changes the name, I think we&#8217;re still going to call ourselves Browning House,\u201d senior Rohan Upadhyayula said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Mulligan expressed a similar sentiment, saying that even if the official name of the dormitory is changed, the name \u201cBrowning House\u201d would remain cemented in his memory. \u201cIt\u2019s always going to be Browning House to me so it doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Although the Academy decided last April that Browning House would be renamed, a new name has yet to be announced.

My favorite subject is definitely history. For extracurriculars, I am a proctor and student listener in Hoyt Hall. I play basketball and throw on the track team. I\u2019m also a member of ALES and I am a part of the dance clubs Precision and In Motion. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">2. I\u2019m gonna say her favorite season is spring. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">a) I\u2019m really bad at favorites but I really like spring and fall. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">3. I know that during cross country season she loves pasta and pizza. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">a) Again, I\u2019m not good with favorites but I really like fruit, especially mangoes. You can never go wrong with a burger though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">4. I think she would like to meet Rihanna because who wouldn\u2019t want to meet Rihanna and I feel like they would vibe well. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">a) I would want to meet Zendaya (or Amandla Steinberg or Chris Evans).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">5. Lauren has always said that she wants to teach something but I don\u2019t know what. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">a) I don\u2019t really know, I\u2019ve been considering going into law.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">6. I think that because we only get to see each other during breaks it\u2019s made me appreciate being together more and that we may even be closer to each other even though we aren\u2019t even in the same state. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">7. It\u2019s really nice having someone who\u2019ll always be there. Together in the womb together till the tomb! Sorry, I love twin puns. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">8. I guess my least favorite part of being a twin would be the constant feeling of comparison, from myself and other people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">9. I think we\u2019re most similar in the fact that we both care a lot and we\u2019re a bit more reserved at first.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">10. For differences I feel like Lauren\u2019s more outspoken than me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16845\" src=\"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Lauren-Lamb.jpg\" alt=\"lauren-lamb\" width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" srcset=\"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Lauren-Lamb.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Lauren-Lamb-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Lauren-Lamb-525x350.jpg 525w, https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Lauren-Lamb-105x70.jpg 105w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Courtesy of Lauren Lamb<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">LAUREN LAMB<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1. My favorite subjects are history and moral reasoning. I am one of the captains of the cross-country and track and field teams. I am president of Choate Slam Poetry Association and Choate Students for Animals. I am one of the Gold Key leaders (Gold Key is our tour guide society). I am involved with our yearbook and I am a prefect in a freshmen dorm. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">2. She doesn\u2019t have a favorite season. She likes different parts of each of them: hot chocolate in the winter, skirts in the spring, the beach in the summer and crunchy leaves in the autumn. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">a) I like autumn and winter\u2014or spring. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">3. She cannot choose a favorite food. But mangoes come pretty close for her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">a) I like cannoli, pizza and green tea Kit Kats. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">4. She would want to meet Beyonc\u00e9 for obvious reasons. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">a) I want to meet Rihanna, Chanel Iman or J. Cole.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">5. Her dream job is a photographer or art curator. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">a) My dream job is in the works. But I wouldn\u2019t mind going into law or education. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">6. Being apart is good for us so we can define our own identities without being defined by or compared by the other one. But at times it is difficult because I feel like we\u2019re growing up without each other. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">7. My favorite part is having someone to tell anything to who won\u2019t judge me or tell anyone else. Also people\u2019s reactions when I tell them I have a twin. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">8. My least favorite part is being compared to her or vice versa and feeling the pressure to compete.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">9. We both have the tendency to put other people before ourselves. And we fight for the title of most indecisive person on the planet. We\u2019re both on the varsity basketball teams but we\u2019re really, really bad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">10.

Moved to  Earlier Time","title_plain":"E\/a Moved to  Earlier Time","content":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As the end of the term approaches, Exonians excitedly anticipate the Exeter\/Andover (E\/a) games, regarded by many students as the ultimate determinant of the superior school, and a cause for celebration and displays of school spirit. The games, hosted this year by Andover on Saturday, Nov. 12, will begin with boys\u2019 varsity soccer in<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>the mid-morning and culminate with varsity football in the early afternoon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A few athletes had concerns over the order of the games and the overlapping times; in the past, the order and timing of games has been more spread out, ending with a football game in the evening. Some athletes reached out to Andover\u2019s Athletic Scheduling Officer and physical education instructor Karen Kennedy to better understand the reasons for the changes. The games are much earlier this year compared to previous fall E\/a games.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Exeter\u2019s Athletic Director Shane LaPointe explained that the schools have different approaches in scheduling the games. She said that Andover tends to condense E\/a to a smaller period of time for games to occur, while Exeter spreads the day out, so that if athletes wanted to watch their friends play, they could visit many of the other games. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Two weeks ago, girls varsity soccer player and senior Veronica Galimberti sent an email to LaPointe expressing her curiosity toward the process of arrangements of the games. When she looked through the schedule, she noted that boys soccer and football were the two out of the five varsity games with their own time slots. \u201cMeanwhile, the three girls games all take place during the span of an hour and a half,\u201d she said. Galimberti said she felt that attendance at the boys games was prioritized since there is no interference during their games. With all of the girls games scheduled so closely together, she said that she is expecting low attendance at each event. She concluded her email stating that she felt that \u201cwomen\u2019s athletics has been cast out of the spotlight for the benefit of our boys\u2019 teams.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In response to Galimberti\u2019s concerns, Kennedy explained that Andover\u2019s arrangement of games is a purposeful action made by the school to counter a \u201cculture that leaves some teams with little peer support while a significantly larger number attend the other game playing at the same time.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">&#8220;Although playing in the day time might take away from the intense atmosphere of previous E\/a\u2019s, it will be warmer, which is beneficial for playing football.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But Galimberti insisted her comments were more about broad cultural facts and were not meant to be pointed toward Andover in particular. \u201cOur move was in response to both of our communities favoring certain games over others and coincided with the 40th anniversary of Title IX,\u201d she said. She explained that the day always seems to start with boys soccer and end the day with football, with the girls teams sandwiched in the middle. While Andover\u2019s winter E\/a, on the other hand, starts and ends with a girls team, winter E\/a\u2019s are notoriously not as well attended as the one that takes place in the fall.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In order to put more focus on supporting all teams, Kennedy said that Andover also observed the prevalence of fans at Exeter\u2019s games. She explained that they \u201cencountered the masses at the boys varsity soccer game even with an hour to go &#8230; while the varsity field hockey game was tied and going into overtime with little peer support.\u201d These observations, made a few years ago, led them to move the times that Andover uses now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">According to Kennedy, since field hockey and football share the same playing space, and field hockey prefers the slot before football, not after, the school ends the fall games with football. She explained that although each soccer team has their own field, the school recognized that the \u201crelatively new Smoyer field is one of the best fields in New England.\u201d If it is in good condition at the end of fall, they opt to play both soccer games on Smoyer to keep all spectators on the east side of Main Street. \u201cBoth teams on Smoyer is relative to crowd control and safety as well as team support\u2014safety by keeping the masses from having to cross Route 28.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, the girls\u2019 soccer team usually plays at Graves, which was the better of the two varsity fields for decades and until Smoyer was built in 2007. \u201cI schedule the girls on Smoyer for a number of home contests each year. However, Graves is considered the home for the girls team [at Andover],\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In response to the idea of showcasing all of the sports games by creating individual playing slots, Kennedy said that it would be unreasonable. Stretching E\/a to accomplish this goal would result in a 10 hour long day, which would be \u201ctoo long for guests, athletic trainers and fans.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lower and field hockey player Lydia Anderson agreed with Kennedy because she felt that anyone who wants to be at her team\u2019s game will make the effort to go and spectate even with the overlap. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to expect everyone to come see every single game. They\u2019re going overlap anyway even if E\/a was set a bit later in the day so it\u2019s not realistic,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Although many athletes expressed both the benefits and disadvantages of playing earlier in the day, some felt upset with potentially lower attendance at the games and the loss of a night tradition. \u201cAlthough playing in the day time might take away from the intense atmosphere of previous E\/a\u2019s, it will be warmer, which is beneficial for playing football. It is easier to catch, and it hurts less to get hit. I would still prefer to play at night, and I think many others would agree,\u201d said upper and football player Willie Swift.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lower and soccer player Nick Tilson would prefer a more expanded schedule that began later in the day because it is more convenient for athletes and viewers. He said that he anticipates lower attendance at all of the games. \u201cFrom the viewpoint of someone who likes to sleep, getting up to see a game later in the afternoon is better than getting up for an early morning game,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Most athletes said that the decreased attendance at some of the competitions may affect the electrifying support of the crowds that makes E\/a so unique. \u201cThe number of spectators will drop definitely, and it totally affects our team energy,\u201d lower and volleyball player Tara Weil said. She explained that her team felt that they usually play better when more people come to support their games. \u201cIt\u2019s always nice to know people care about our sport or about the people on the team,\u201d Weil said. Lower Jenny Yang agreed with Weil, but she added that in general, volleyball \u201chas a good amount of spectators, but other sports might not feel as appreciated.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Upper and volleyball player Chloe Scocimara did not mind the earlier schedule, but she explained that she can never support her friends when all of the girls sports are around the same time. Fans must choose what games to attend, which, according to Scocimara, is not fair for teams. \u201cWe always preach about supporting all teams but with this early schedule it doesn\u2019t allow us to,\u201d she said. Unlike Weil, she is not concerned about the number of fans and described her team as their own cheerleaders. \u201cThere could be just my dad or the whole school and I would still be as nervous,\u201d she said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Despite these issues, athletes are still excited to play against Andover at the end of the term and look forward to Exeter\u2019s support. \u201cI think we will maintain a solid performance, but it would definitely make our jobs easier if more spectators watched games,\u201d Weil said.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>As the end of the term approaches, Exonians excitedly anticipate the Exeter\/Andover (E\/a) games, regarded by many students as the ultimate determinant of the superior school, and a cause for celebration and displays of school spirit.

The largest contributors to the decline are young adults, becoming 26 percent less patriotic over the last decade. Considering recent events, this is unsurprising. After American patriotism spiked following 9\/11 to bind the country together through a difficult time, it has steadily fallen. The economic crisis from 2007 to 2009 didn\u2019t help national pride. Nor have police brutality videos on social media, a new and dangerous Islamic terrorist group, and a presidential race that could be picked out of an extreme <i>Would You Rather?<\/i> book.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">This election has people split into two distinct camps. However, many people feel they are voting for the lesser of two evils, without fully believing in their candidate. This is understandable considering we are choosing between a racist billionaire and a woman who has a new cover-up scandal every other week. Most of the campaign ads have been about attacking the competition and the debates are even worse. Both candidates often interrupt the moderator, dodged audience questions in the town hall debate, and spend most of the time fighting each other with precious little discussion of the issues that will impact each of us for the next four years. If we cannot be invested in the future leader of America, how can we be invested in the future of the country?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">America\u2019s decline has its roots in the way we educate new generations. The education system in this country has immense faults throughout and prevents America from having a future. Public schools are underfunded and teachers there are often not equipped to deal with their students. The alternative for those who want a good education is private institutions, where the costs are steep and competition rages. Policies are on the ballot this year that would divert even more funding from our public system to charter schools instead of fixing the problem at hand. Without a future generation of educated workers, we cannot trust ourselves to make the right decisions and move the country forward. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Fewer and fewer people are concerned with making a change; more are focused on how much money they can amass for themselves. Formerly the pinnacle of innovation, we now borrow things from other countries or rely on a select few visionaries to carry us forth. Silicon Valley used to be concerned with changing the way we interact as a species and revolutionizing industries. It is now more concerned with getting us to stay on a page longer so we see more ads.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">On the foreign policy front, our relationships with the world are the worst they have been in ages. We back Saudi Arabia, which recently bombed a Yemeni funeral, killing and injuring hundreds. Our relationship with Israel is now on rocky ground after we withdrew some support for the Israelis in the UN. We are entangled in a Syrian civil war, riddled with human rights abominations and pitting us against Russia, a major rival that we desperately need to establish better ties with. Both the USA and Russia independently have enough nuclear weapons to end human civilization but we are making enemies of each other. Domestically, ISIS terror attacks abroad spread fear and ignorant racism against Muslims across our country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">With a bleak future to look forward to and the present in a bewildered state, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see our patriotism fall even further. Just in the past year, we have had to deal with race issues, police brutality, over 300 mass shootings, sexual assaults on our school campuses and a truly deplorable presidential race. Jobs disappear overseas and innovations barely crawls along. The primarily American obsession with personal wealth will be our undoing. On top of everything, we are the singular generation tasked with avoiding mass-extinction of our species by climate change. God help us.

Last year, Exeter lost to Tabor 0-6, so they hoped to improve and they knew that they had to bring their A-game. According to co-captain and senior Abby Yu, \u201cthe difficult thing about playing Tabor was the they used a similar game strategy as us.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The rain showers prior to the game caused the turf to be slippery and the moderate winds made the weather especially cold. The conditions were not ideal, but the girls made it work. Regardless of the weather, the girls on the field hustled from the very start and played with a lot of intensity. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The first half of the game was fairly equal between the two teams. Tabor was able to work the ball into Exeter\u2019s defensive end, and they kept the pressure on Big Red\u2019s defense. Luckily, Exeter\u2019s strong defensive unit and the team\u2019s rock-solid goalies stopped all of their opponent\u2019s early advances.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cOur defense did a great job, but we need to work on keeping the ball on the offensive end, even after fouling.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">After some hard fought battles and winning a few 50-50 balls, the girls were able to string their passes together and march down the field towards the Tabor net. Great passing and earning fouls helped the girls maintain possession, and they got off a couple of great shots. Unfortunately, the team was not able to convert on these opportunities and the game continued on scoreless. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lower Catherine Griffin noted, \u201cOur defense did a great job, but we need to work on keeping the ball on the offensive end even after fouling.\u201d Many of her teammates shared this belief and the team will hope to improve on their offensive possession so that they can generate more shots in future games. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Before the end of the first half, Tabor was able to find a way through the Exeter players and added the first goal of the game. During half time, the girls were proud that they were keeping the game so close and continued to play hard in the second half.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Often, the team can become a little demoralized if they let in a goal, but that was not the case for Exeter this weekend. Even after Tabor\u2019s second and final goal, the girls\u2019 quality of play was relentless. Although Exeter was not able to make a comeback and lost the game, they were still happy that they were able to keep the game close against a tough team. Upper and team manager Kaleigh Conte noted that, \u201cBoth goalies did a great job, and senior Michaela Corvi had a very strong offensive game.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> Lower Michaela O\u2019Brien said that the team\u2019s goals for the rest of the season are to \u201cbeat Andover and get [their record] to 500.\u201d With the team\u2019s current record of 5-9, they will need to win their final five games of the season to meet their goals, but after their great performance against Tabor they feel optimistic. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>This past Saturday, the Exeter girls\u2019 field hockey team played a competitive game against Tabor, but ended up losing 0-2.

Executive Board Proposes New Referendum","title_plain":"StuCo Executive Board Proposes New Referendum","content":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Student Council (StuCo) Executive Board introduced a referendum proposal at last Tuesday\u2019s meeting. The proposal states that if over half of the student body signs a petition requesting to have a certain issue be put to a vote, or the majority of StuCo votes in favor of having a campus-wide referendum on some issue, a referendum will be held. Whatever policy being proposed through the referendum would then pass if a majority of the student body votes in favor, with a voter turnout rate of over 50 percent. In addition, the proposal allows the student body to recall any elected official by earning over two-thirds of the vote in a recall referendum, which can be triggered through a petition signed by over two-thirds of students. The particulars of this plan were discussed by council members throughout the meeting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The referendums would be held on one of three major election dates during the school year, the date of the Prep Class Representative elections, the Discipline Committee elections and the Executive Board elections. The referendum for a certain issue would be held on the election date closest to when all of the signatures on a petition have been verified or to when StuCo votes to hold a referendum. Any decision made through a referendum would be considered binding. However, the Executive Board will be given the discretion to rule any referendum question invalid despite having gained the requisite number of signatures for \u201creasons of blatant impracticality and sensibility,\u201d according to the proposal. Failed referendum questions may be raised again, within certain limitations. If less than one third of the student body vote for a certain referendum, the matter at hand cannot be voted upon again until one year after the voting day. If a referendum gains more than one-third of the student body\u2019s vote, but less than a majority, it cannot be raised for the next referendum date but can be voted upon for subsequent referendum dates. Referendum votes do not have the power to allocate or appropriate funds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">StuCo President Matthew Robbins ran on a platform last spring during the presidential elections which included this referendum proposal as part of his larger goal of democratizing StuCo and giving a greater voice to the student body.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cThe referendum policy is meant to get the entire student body involved in political decisions.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Referendum policy is intended to give students agency in campus politics. \u201cReferendums are a way for the student body to directly put in place a policy,\u201d Robbins said. \u201cThis will allow for all students to have a say on matter of high importance to them.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In proposing this referendum policy, the Executive Board hopes to give more power to students and to encourage the general student population to participate in campus politics. \u201cThe referendum policy is meant to get the entire student body involved in political decisions,\u201d lower and Secretary Jackson Parrell said. \u201cIt allows students to bypass decisions made in StuCo by instead presenting policy changes to the entire student body.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There was some debate at StuCo on the threshold for the number of signatures necessary on the petition and for the voter turnout rate that must be met for an initiative to pass. Certain members of StuCo felt that both thresholds were too high, considering the historically low voter turnout rates for major campus-wide elections. The voter turnout rate for the final round of the 2015-2016 executive board election was 50.6 percent, while the voter turnout rate for the final round of the 2016-2017 executive board election was 44.6 percent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Cade Napier, a dorm representative for Soule Hall, was in favor of the referendum policy remaining as it is. \u201cI think that the [current] referendum [policy] is pretty reasonable, because if there are important issues being voted upon half of the student body will show up to vote. The referendum policy isn\u2019t designed to be overused,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">On the other hand, upper Will Soltas, a dorm representative for Cilley Hall, felt that the current proposal was impractical. He felt that the elections committee would not handle the logistics of hosting the proposed referendum. He thought the introduction of electronic voting for referendum proposals could improve the policy. \u201cWhile I do think the referendum process is important, I don\u2019t think the process, as it stands right now, is possible,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The referendum amendment will be put to a vote in StuCo at a later meeting.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>The Student Council (StuCo) Executive Board introduced a referendum proposal at last Tuesday\u2019s meeting.

Rather than simply hosting discussions or advocating for Democratic policies in conversations on campus, the club seeks to take part in strategies employed by campaigns. \u201cDem Club demonstrates our support for our candidates by putting in a lot of work to the campaigns and through specific actions,\u201d co-head and senior Charis Edwards said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The club and its members have been phone banking and canvassing in conjunction with the local Clinton campaign office throughout the fall, and intend to do so through election day. Their ultimate goal is to improve visibility for all Democratic candidates. \u201cWe try our best to get our candidates\u2019 names, all the way down the ticket, known,\u201d Bahnasy said. Club adviser Jackie Weatherspoon noted the power of canvassing and phone-banking. \u201cIt takes less than 10 seconds to engage the public,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While the club also creates opportunity for discussion on political topics by hosting debate watch parties, during election season the members divert their attention away from the typical discussion meetings to working primarily on electing Democratic candidates. \u201cWhile we value discussion, when the opportunity presents itself, we focus on doing the work to get our ticket elected,\u201d Edwards said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cWe try our best to get our candidates\u2019 names, all the way down the ticket, known.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In addition, the Democratic Club has provided transportation for members of the Exeter community to attend Democratic events around the Seacoast area, including rallies for Hillary Clinton and dinners for New Hampshire and Seacoast area Democrats. Events such as those serve to rally students behind the Democratic cause. \u201cWe hope that all these experiences that the students have had this year will get them excited to want to really support the Democrats,\u201d Weatherspoon said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">She added that in activities the Democratic Club has been hosting in the past term, the club hopes to encourage its members to find candidates they can get behind, and to participate in the political process to get them elected. \u201cIt\u2019s about students getting involved and finding a candidate that they are passionate about,\u201d Weatherspoon said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Republican Club, on the other hand, has continued to keep its focus on fostering discussion rather than campaigning for Republican candidates. The club has continued to host its regular dinner discussions, and has not been involved with any phone-banking or canvassing. Their only election specific activity has been to co-host debate watching parties with the Democratic Club.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Alec Howe, a co-head of the club, explained that the club doesn\u2019t participate in campaign activities as a group, and has a strict policy against endorsing any candidates. The club\u2019s leadership felt that doing so would alienate members of campus. \u201c[Endorsing a candidate could] reduce the intellectual vitality of our conversations and damage our club\u2019s reputation as a place where Exonians of all political backgrounds can meet to engage in respectful dialogue,\u201d Howe said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Other political projects are currently in the works. The Exeter Political Union is working on hosting a mock election, and is planning on disseminating information on voter registration. The Democratic Club is trying to host a voter registration booth on campus, open to those affiliated with all parties. If the club is unable to put together a booth, they plan on sending busses to polls on Election Day, taking advantage of New Hampshire\u2019s same day registration. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In addition, the Democratic Club will be hosting its annual \u201cDem Club Fives\u201d to encourage voters on Election Day. Any student will be able to join the Democratic Club as they deliver reminders on voting to area residents early that morning. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Bahnasy highlighted the event as her favorite of the year, as she felt that it allowed her to have a direct impact on the election. \u201cIt\u2019s so enjoyable and thrilling to know you can make a difference in the outcome of the presidential election,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Two candidates in New Hampshire races are also connected closely to the Academy community. Governor Maggie Hassan, who is the wife of former PEA Principal Tom Hassan, is running for one of New Hampshire\u2019s U.S. Senate seats. And Alexis Simpson, who is married to religion instructor Tom Simpson, is running for New Hampshire\u2019s state senate in District 23.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>The Democratic Club is campaigning for both, and both and running as Democratic Party<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>candidates. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>With less than a week to go until Election Day, campus political clubs and various student organizations have been participating in the political process by fostering discussion, helping students campaign for candidates and community members register to vote.

Fiber, often found in nature in the form of bark, prevents diverticular disease and is even speculated to reduce the risk of colon cancer.

The speakers will start out saying, or at some point mention, that they are standing in front of a room full of The Best and the Brightest, and, my personal favorite, the World\u2019s Future Leaders.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">&#8220;At the end of the day, Exonians are simply not the Best. We are overworked, we are tired and we are fed dessert three times a day.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Now, the World\u2019s Future Leaders line is particularly ridiculous because it\u2019s simply not possible. I for instance don\u2019t want to lead anyone anywhere, and instead like to entertain the idea that someday I could be a writer, living alone in a tiny house in the middle of nowhere. But I also know a lot of Exonians who want to be things like chemical engineers or journalists, which are not typically \u201cleader of the world,\u201d kind of jobs. Now, if we stretch the idea of \u201cleader\u201d out far enough, we could probably say that \u201cevery Exonian will be a leader in anything they do,\u201d but that can be said of anyone who stays in a field or a job long enough, does their job well and climbs the career ladder. If we define it that way, then my brother is on track to be a Future Leader at the local Five Guys he works at. It suggests that we are already and automatically set to lead the world when we leave Exeter just by being Exonians, regardless of the fact that many Exonians will not go on to be leaders and that many who never attended Exeter will. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">But I would also like to make the case that we are not, in fact, the Best and the Brightest, and that actually, being constantly called such does more damage to us than good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I don\u2019t deny that Exeter is made up of smart, hardworking kids. But it\u2019s not realistic that we have all of the smartest, most hardworking kids in the nation, and certainly not the world. Some of those kids applied to a lot of private schools, got into most of them, and probably picked Andover. Some of those kids are too poor, or too far away, or have too good of a relationship with their parents to attend Exeter. A lot of those kids didn\u2019t apply. Some of them did apply, but got rejected because all admissions systems are faulty and subjective. Some of those kids don\u2019t speak English. Some of those kids might have a passion for acting or dancing that Exeter wouldn\u2019t have given them time or credit for. The list goes on.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">But more importantly, after being constantly called \u201cthe Best and the Brightest,\u201d so often and for so long, being the Best and the Brightest becomes part of our identity as Exonians and it becomes some sort of ultimate standard that we must reach. But it\u2019s impossible to reach, and so two things happen. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The first, which I\u2019ve seen a lot of, is putting other people down. I\u2019ve experienced this while standing in a group of Exonians watching a parade of Exeter High School kids go by and listening to the day student Exonians talk to the boarding Exonians about how dumb the kids who go to that school are. I\u2019ve experienced it at a private school conference for a school club where most of the Exonians present talked for the majority of the conference about how stupid the questions the students from all the other schools had asked were. I hear this kind of stuff all the time at Exeter, even from the students I find least elitist, and even, admittedly, from myself. Putting others down is one of the only ways we can feel secure in this Best and Brightest label. By pointing out others\u2019 flaws, we justify to ourselves why we deserve the \u201cBest High School Education in America,\u201d and why it is that we (as individuals and a student body) are told that we are so high above everyone else. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The second thing that seems to happen is that we are afraid to fail and learn by making mistakes. When suddenly being the smartest is so important, and when you are told that everyone around you is the smartest in the world, taking a risk and falling on your face becomes something even more risky, because it endangers you the exposure of being stupid amongst genius peers. I\u2019ve noticed that often the students who come across the smartest are the students who are very good at figuring out what the teacher wants, rather than the students who think for themselves but sometimes end up looking foolish. And Exonians are obsessed with pleasing their teachers. If I had a dollar for every time I heard someone say that you\u2019ll get an A by writing about this thing for that teacher, or that someone got a bad grade because the teacher didn\u2019t like them, then I could probably afford to pay full tuition. But even worse is this obsession with impressing the other students around us, because one wrong step and we may fail the Best and Brightest label and fall into the category of the kids who Exonians look down on. We spend a lot of time thinking about scamming our way through the system, rather than just being interested, engaged and critical students. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">At the end of the day, Exonians are simply not the Best. We are overworked, we are tired and we are fed dessert three times a day. If we were the best, we\u2019d probably be better at being humble. We\u2019re just not, and that\u2019s okay. Not being the Best doesn\u2019t make us any less curious, diligent, thoughtful and interested about matters of the world. But I think we are selling ourselves short by buying into the idea of \u201cthe Best and the Brightest,\u201d rather than engaging fully and openly with the world around us, accepting it as full of people who want to learn and think just as much as we do. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>If you can stretch back far enough in the archives of your mind to remember the last time you went to Assembly (I know, it\u2019s hard for me too), then you might remember a common theme among a lot of assembly speakers.

Covering over 70 percent of the Earth\u2019s surface and comprising 99 percent of its living space, oceans influence almost every aspect of life on our planet. The seas play a major role in driving the water cycle and weather patterns; phytoplankton living in the ocean produce over half of our atmosphere\u2019s oxygen. Not only did life evolve from the seas\u2014it depends on them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The importance of our oceans is undeniable, yet climate change and pollution threaten to throw off their delicate balance. At DORSAL, we are committed to learning about these amazing ecosystems and their preservation in a changing world. During our weekly meetings, we read articles describing the latest events affecting the ocean, such as Hurricane Matthew, and watch documentaries on diverse marine environments and their impact on the world. We hold discussions on everything from overfishing to how polar bears get water.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In addition to our discussion meetings, we also take field trips to observe marine life and environments. In previous years, DORSAL has worked with UNH\u2019s Coastal Habitat Restoration Team to plant beach grass on Plum Island. Last year, we also visited the New England Aquarium in Boston. We are planning to make the aquarium trip again this spring, and hope to make trips to our local beaches as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">On campus, we\u2019re also considering the start of some projects that would raise awareness of marine issues; some examples include making displays showing the effects of ocean acidification and the ramifications of eating certain fish. By pursuing these projects, we hope to show everyone that the ocean touches our lives more ways than we may think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">DORSAL meets every Tuesday from 7 to 8 p.m. in the Academy Center\u2019s TV Lounge.

Imagine on Nov. 8 the voters of our country choose to put Donald Trump in the Oval Office all because of a mistake. Well, that day may be upon us. The Director of the FBI, James Comey, sent a letter to Congress regarding an email investigation of Clinton staffer, Huma Abedin. The ludacris letter was supposedly necessary to send because the FBI obtained information relating to the original Clinton email incident. Comey claims that, \u201cIn connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the case.\u201d Not only is it unconventional for the Director of the FBI to write to Congress about an investigation, but there is no evidence that there is a connection between these emails and Secretary Clinton\u2019s. The message, sent less than two weeks from November 8, was uncalled for, illegal and only written to influence the outcome of the election. Because of this, James Comey should be removed as Director of the FBI.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">&#8220;Comey has a history of making rude comments toward Clinton such as calling her &#8216;extremely careless.'&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The inquiry initially began when Abedin\u2019s ex-husband, Former Congressman Anthony Weiner, allegedly sent inappropriate pictures to a young girl. However, FBI investigators deduced that there is a possibility that the emails have some significance to the Clinton case. This doubt is reflected in a letter from Comey to his employees when he stated, \u201cAt the same time, however, given that we don\u2019t know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails\u2026\u201d Not only does Comey himself imply that there is no evidence that the emails can be connected to the previous misconduct, he writes about the rarity of an FBI Director sending a letter to Congress. \u201cOf course, we don\u2019t ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations\u2026\u201d Even Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said, \u201cTo throw out this kind of letter without more information, without really knowing what the facts are with respect to these additional emails, I think was a mistake.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Not only was it unfitting to send Congress a letter regarding such an underdeveloped investigation, but it was completely inappropriate to write it with political influence as Comey\u2019s motivation. Comey has a history of making rude comments toward Clinton such as calling her \u201cextremely careless.\u201d Director Comey also investigated the Clinton scandal himself, giving him a bias against her. In the memo to his employees, the Director claims that if he were to not supplement the record \u201cit would be misleading to the American people\u2026\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">If it is indeed true that Director Comey wrote the letter to influence the election, it would be a clear abuse of power and a violation of the Hatch Act of 1939. The Hatch Act \u201cis a United States federal law whose main provision prohibits employees in the executive branch of the federal government, except the president, vice-president, and certain designated high-level officials of that branch, from engaging in some forms of political activity.\u201d Any official who breaks this law should be terminated from their position. It is clear that James Comey sent this letter to Congress to communicate his own political agenda. Not only did he break ethical code and standard FBI procedure, he broke a law. It is time for President Obama to pick a new Director of the FBI. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Picture this: Hillary Clinton\u2019s valiant pursuit to the Presidency is ruined just days before the election by someone this country needs to trust most.

During the Cold War, tensions between the two countries reached their peak as they reached a time of political and military contention involving the Space Race and development of nuclear weapons. Even though war was not physically fought, that was an unprecedented time in history. The US-Russia relationship became better with the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, but current relations have rapidly deteriorated again due to the presidency of Vladimir Putin. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">According to Sergey Kislyak, Russia\u2019s ambassador to America, the quality of relations between America and Russia is at its lowest point since the Cold War. Igor Zevelev, former director of the MacArthur Foundation\u2019s Russia office said that it was even worse, calling it a \u201cmuch more dangerous and unpredictable situation.\u201d To me, this can partially be blamed on Russia for actions on its part. Vladimir Putin and the Russian government must stop their egregious violations of the unspoken but basic rules regarding international relations. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">On July 22nd, WikiLeaks published approximately 19,000 leaked emails and 8,000 attachments from the Democratic National Committee on its website. A hacker by the alias of Guccifer 2.0 took responsibility for the leaks, but cybersecurity firms like SecureWorks and CrowdStrike agreed that Russian intelligence groups committed the leaks. There is evidence to prove that someone with a senior position in the Russian government had a role in orchestrating the cyber attack. The Washington Post also noted that Trump and Putin deflected questions about the hack in the same way: by first questioning the ability of hackers to be accurately traced, then focusing on the content of the emails instead, which contained messages disparaging Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign. If it is true that members of the Russian government orchestrated or encouraged the DNC hack, it sets a dangerous precedent, one that allows a country to interfere in the politics of another for its own benefit. Yes, the Russian government wants Trump to become the next president because Clinton is known as one of the most outspoken officials when it comes to addressing Putin expanding his power and sphere of influence. Nevertheless, for them to try and rig the election through swaying public opinion is inappropriate and morally detestable. It is also ironic that Putin has stated his need to \u201csafeguard ourselves from this interference in our internal affairs,\u201d when there is proof that his government has meddled in the affairs of so many countries, like the annexation of Crimea in 2014. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Another event that has caused a conflict between America and Russia is the bombing of Aleppo, which has been described by the BBC as \u201ca key battleground in Syria\u2019s bloody five-year civil war.\u201d After a short-lived ceasefire, US ambassador to the UN Samantha Power called the bombing of the city \u201cbarbarism.\u201d Meanwhile, Russia claimed that its forces and Assad\u2019s forces were targeting terrorists in Aleppo while harming as few citizens as possible. On October 3rd, the US government suspended talks with Russia on negotiating a ceasefire agreement on Syria, thereby also effectively ending a chance to halt the violence in the country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">In the wake of bad relations, Russia could be preparing for war. According to the <i>Daily Star<\/i>, senior Russian officials with children or other relatives in foreign countries have been told to bring them back to the \u201cFatherland.\u201d Surely the American government and military are also prepared in case of an emergency, but if these strained relations aren\u2019t mended quickly, World War III could be ignited. It would be on a scale never seen before, with new weapon technology emerging that can annihilate entire cities in a matter of seconds and reduce them to ashes. To escape the prospect of a global war involving nuclear weapons, we need to fix US-Russia relations\u2014now. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Throughout history, the political relationship between America and Russia hasn\u2019t always been the best\u2014and that\u2019s a nice way of putting it.

She then outlined things the team did well, such as passing the ball, keeping possession and playing through the entire game, \u201cwhich was something that we haven\u2019t always done in the past,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The team is anticipating a close game during the annual E\/a games next weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">According to upper Samantha Weaver, one way the team can improve is by controlling the ball in the air and making strong passes to each others feet. They will continue working on their cohesiveness as a group and finishing on offense. Weaver said that each year the team gets closer to beating Andover. Last year, the game ended in a tie. \u201cI think this year we will come out with a win,\u201d Weaver said. For this to happen, she thinks they need to create more scoring opportunities and win every ball in the air.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI only believe if Andover thinks this is an easy win for them, they will be quite shocked come E\/a,\u201d Bartkovich said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The team\u2019s last home game will be Wednesday, Nov. 9 against New Hampton School.

After an astonishing 6-0 win against Berwick Academy on Wednesday, Oct. 26, the boys were in high spirits for their Tabor game. And though they didn\u2019t end up getting the result they had hoped for, the energy, determination and skill with which they played on Saturday demonstrated how much they have improved as a team over the past two months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Upper Jack Baker described the game against Tabor as a testament to the team\u2019s strong work ethic. \u201cEveryone on the field was ready to go from the first whistle, and we maintained that energy throughout the game,\u201d he explained. Senior and captain Quintin DiStefano agreed, and praised the team for \u201cplaying aggressively and working hard for the full 90 minutes.\u201d Likewise, lower Jonah Johnson observed that \u201ceveryone on the team was working as hard as they had all season.\u201d For the seniors, the game against Tabor was their last home game ever, and they were \u201cgiving their 100 percent to leave it all on the field,\u201d according to DiStefano. Despite the game resulting in a draw, upper Dolapo Adedokun felt that it had shown how much the team has developed, saying \u201cwe played our best soccer of the season.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cWe are happy with the way we played, now we have to move on and get ready for the next game.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The boys proved particularly successful at moving the ball in the attacking third while remaining calm and relaxed. In addition, their defense was solid and they gave up almost no corners throughout the entire game. According to senior Collin Shapiro, the team was \u201cvery effective at pressuring the ball and forcing turnovers as well as our being creative on the ball.\u201d He continued, \u201cI thought we did a good job of moving off the ball.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This aggressive pressure on the ball allowed the team to keep possession for the majority of the game and create scoring opportunities as they moved up the field, including some impressive, low-driven crosses across the box which were \u201creally dangerous for Tabor,\u201d according to Baker. \u201cWe created a lot of great chances,\u201d he continued. Exeter also generated several corner kicks that were difficult for Tabor to handle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, despite creating around 10 chances to score in all, the team was unable to put the ball away due to a lack of finishing and a series of remarkable saves from Tabor\u2019s goalie. \u201cTabor had one of the best goalkeepers we have seen all season,\u201d Baker said. The goalie\u2019s ability in the air prevented many scoring chances on Exeter\u2019s crosses, while his deep kick challenged them in the back. \u201cI think that we created good opportunities to score, but Tabor\u2019s goalie was nasty and he made a lot of great saves,\u201d Johnson further explained. Similarly, Adedokun noted that, \u201cdespite all of our good work, we struggled to score because Tabor has an insane goalkeeper.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Going forward, the team hopes to work on finishing these scoring opportunities and getting the ball in the back of the net, according to Johnson. Baker pointed out that the team has \u201creally been clicking\u201d in the past few games, and success will follow if they maintain their positive energy. Shapiro echoed this and added, \u201cI like the way we are playing right now and the goals will come.\u201d DiStefano also commended the team\u2019s hard work. \u201cWe are happy with the way we played, now we have to move on and get ready for the next game,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Exeter is scheduled to play against Holderness School this Saturday and against Kimball Union Academy next Wednesday.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>The boys\u2019 varsity soccer team competed against Tabor Academy in a riveting game this past Saturday that finished in a 0-0 tie but showcased the team\u2019s best playing all season.

a girl. I\u2019ve read all the magazines, searched for all the conversational tips, but I still feel like I mess up every time I try to approach her. There she is, living in this perfect Garden of Eden, with that perfect boyfriend of hers. What\u2019s his name? Adobe? Adar? Adam? I think that\u2019s it. What a stupid name!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Honestly, what does she see in him? I\u2019m just as good. Sure, I\u2019m green and scaly, and he\u2019s got this perfect olive skin that matches those big, brown eyes. But, I have character. Plus, doesn\u2019t she find it a little creepy that she was made out of his ribs? I don\u2019t know about you, diary, but that feels implicitly incestual to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">I\u2019ve tried to approach her, and tried to ask her out to hang out by the beautiful little pond with the lily pads. But every time I see her, skipping around, with all those curls and that wonderful smile, I melt. I choke up every time I want to talk to her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">How do people pick up women? I\u2019ve been reading <i>Cosmopolitan <\/i>lately. I was reviewing a list that was titled, \u201c10 Ways to Get a Girl to Notice You.\u201d According to the article, girls like guys who verge on the \u201cbad boy\u201d side. I bet that\u2019s what Adam is. He\u2019s aloof and never really is conscious of anything he does. Maybe that\u2019s why Eve is into him. Because he\u2019s this mysterious dude that isn\u2019t really in the moment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Damn it. I\u2019m just too much of a nice snake. The other day, I was eating a Milky Way bar, and threw the wrapper into a blueberry bush, and literally cried with the most guilt I had ever felt. I\u2019m so much of a goody two shoes: I went to prep school growing up, a boarding school nearby, where I got an unbelievable GPA in incredibly high courses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">But I was never athletic enough. I was never attractive enough. My skin was too green, or my scales were uneven, or my tongue was too forked. Don\u2019t we all have flaws? Shouldn\u2019t we learn to love each other beyond looks, especially in such a paradise like Eden? I bet Eve was voted most beautiful in high school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Here, I think I\u2019m going to actively try to verge more on the dangerous side. I mean, there\u2019s not so much that can go wrong. Hey, I think I\u2019ll try to bump into her tomorrow. She always goes to bathe next to the fountain next to the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. She rinses her hair with lavender and herbal oils that I can smell from a mile away, so she\u2019ll be easy to find.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Another interesting thing: So, I don\u2019t know the main details, but apparently God told Adam and Eve not to touch the fruit on that tree. Man, what type of high would that fruit give that even God doesn\u2019t want us to try it out? I mean, I never was really into drugs. I drank once at a party, and cried for three days after, but this is a new phase for me. If I want to be a bad boy, I need to take risks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">My plan tomorrow: Get her to take a ride on a wild side. I\u2019ll encourage her to eat the fruit. Once she gets that rush, she\u2019ll see how cool and nonchalant I am, and totally drop Adam for me! We could have little biracial children (half reptilian, half human, though I believe I had a great, great Native American ancestor). Man, I\u2019m so excited.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Okay, diary. I\u2019ll keep you updated on how it all goes. Catch you later! I\u2019m sure, by this time tomorrow, I\u2019ll have Eve wrapped around my little finger!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Love,<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Serpent<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Dear Diary, Okay, so maybe I have a crush on a girl.

Padding resumes promotes this notion that actions such as going to Third World countries and snapping a few pictures with the natives should make a huge splash even if there\u2019s no meaningful follow-up or insight from that adventure. On paper, it sounds like a masterful shortcut, but can such an inorganic padding of resumes actually boost chances of college acceptance?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Firstly, we shouldn\u2019t ignorantly assume that college admissions officers will not see through this: they are actually chosen especially based on their ability to do so. An emerging trend connecting to the padding resume hypothesis is the creation of non-profit organizations that are run by high-schoolers and are supposed to stand in for a bulk of a student\u2019s community service. According to <i>The New York Times<\/i>, Angel Perez, an admissions officer at the Trinity College in Hartford, stated that there were running jokes about non-profits or \u201cmission trips\u201d to less-privileged places in the world in the admissions office. Another admissions official, Jennifer Delahunty from Kenyon College, stated that mission-trip application essays actually get sorted into their group. The topic has become cliche and admissions officers now hold that students should be well-aware of socio-economic divides that are prevalent across the globe. However, some mission trips are definitely going to be sincere, so how can they differentiate between padding and genuine initiative? The application essays are reasonably expected to reflect a much richer understanding of the inter-workings of the environment the student was exposed to. Admissions officers acknowledge that quantity does not necessarily amount to quality and we should take heed of that when budgeting our time to activities we strive for just for the sake of padding up our resumes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The whole notion of padding resumes is also profitable for colleges and college preparatory programs and provides quite the fuel for legally approved, money-making scandals. Branching off from the notion of resume padding directly, comes the theory that applying and partaking in summer school programs at the specific school in question should significantly increase the chance that the student lands in that school. There\u2019s almost always some advertisement in famous magazines like <i>Time<\/i> or even online on academic-related sites that points to a summer enrichment program hosted at a big-name college as being the ultimate answer. The money raked in from these programs has exponentially increased in the past few years and even though the sponsors of these programs also created these opportunities for genuine and predominantly amazing informational purposes, they\u2019re choosing now, notably the age of the \u201chelicopter parents\u201d, to strike the hardest to maximize the returns. According to <i>The Guardian<\/i>, Dean Skarlis, president of The College Advisor of New York, himself noted that such summer schools programs are obviously \u201crevenue streams\u201d and that \u201cstudents should only attend if they\u2019re really interested in the career area offered.\u201d There\u2019s no secret record of the students who apply for such programs at that school that\u2019s being kept by the school for reference for future admissions processes; these are just educational programs simply designed for enhancing our knowledge in specific topics and taking our money as compensation. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Padding resumes is evidently a cheap, last-ditch attempt that\u2019s even being utilized by summer enrichment programs sponsored by colleges and college preparatory programs to exploit families across the nation. It\u2019s still probably impressive that you were at a summer internship at a hospital or on a trip to a foreign nation for some noble cause or out of an interest of some kind. But, colleges are clearly not just looking for initiative; they are looking for authenticity and initiative behind those layers of padding. In summary, it is beneficial to strive for leadership positions and to display initiative, but it\u2019s better to do so in aspects where we feel an especially strong intrinsic calling to and not just a mere desire to blindly aim for the college we believe has the best brand.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>\u201cMore extracurriculars and more leadership positions should grant me a better probability of going to the college of my choice.\u201d As the college acceptance arena becomes increasingly competitive year after the year and the prevalence of \u201chelicopter parents\u201d starts to come further to its front [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","date":"2016-11-03 19:53:46","modified":"2016-11-03 19:53:46","categories":[{"id":3,"slug":"opinion","title":"Opinion","description":"","parent":0,"post_count":750}],"tags":[{"id":180,"slug":"2016-11-03","title":"2016-11-03","description":"","post_count":35}],"author":{"id":68,"slug":"lleatham","name":"Lauren Leatham","first_name":"Lauren","last_name":"Leatham","nickname":"lleatham","url":"","description":""},"comments":[],"attachments":[],"comment_count":0,"comment_status":"closed","custom_fields":{"authors":["Shaan Bhandarkar"],"title-short":["Resume Padding"],"photo_type":["horizontal"],"photo_caption":[""],"photo_credit":[""],"photo_alignment":[""],"web-editors":["Lauren Leatham"],"highlights":[""]}},{"id":16868,"type":"post","slug":"esso-in-action-17","url":"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/2016\/11\/03\/esso-in-action-17\/","status":"publish","title":"ESSO in Action","title_plain":"ESSO in Action","content":"<p class=\"p1\">Pen Pals for Haiti has been a part of my Exeter experience since prep year.

I had attended the club for three years before becoming a club head and it was all because of the lovely messages I received and was able to return to my pen pal. I remember being in a pen pal program with a local high school when I was in third grade and I thought that was the most amazing thing in the world. Imagine how these kids are feeling, writing to other kids like them in a totally different country. It is a huge privilege for us to get in touch with the students in Carrefour, Haiti. Pen Pals for Haiti strives to create friendship and a real human connection between students in different parts of the world. We try to teach our club members more about Haiti\u2019s history and part of their culture. During the year, students get to see in the letters they receive just how much they are doing to help these kids practice their English skills. You will have lots of fun coming to our club and you can practice your French too. The letters are written in English though, so if you don\u2019t have any previous knowledge of French, it is okay. We meet around four times a term to write\/read our letters and talk about other things concerning what we want to do as a club. New members are welcome anytime and new ideas\/perspectives as well!

The terrorists, who killed 12 people and injured eleven, were enraged at an image of Muhammad that <i>Charlie Hebdo<\/i> had produced, which poked fun at the Muslim prophet. In the following weeks, people from all over the world held vigils and promoted the hashtag #jesuisCharlie to support the <i>Charlie Hebdo<\/i> victims. Demonstrators also wished to bring awareness to acts of terror so they could be prevented.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Despite the overwhelming response from people enraged by the tragedy, it happened again; in November of the same year, attackers in Paris killed one hundred and thirty people, including 89 at the Bataclan theater. Many people blamed France\u2019s lack of security, and its inability to prevent fatal terrorist attacks, on the serial shootings. Others, however, blamed another group of people who had a lesser role in the events: the demonstrators who showed support during the <i>Charlie Hebdo<\/i> attacks. Calling these people \u201chashtag activists,\u201d or the less positive \u201cslacktivists,\u201d they claimed that, instead of using hashtags and vigils to promote change, the protesters were better off assisting victims and their families with \u201creal\u201d signs of solidarity, such as monetary and material donations. The phenomenon of the hashtag activist has arisen in reaction to recent tragedies and advancing technology, and its creation reflects the way people deal with large-scale tragedies and social controversies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Slacktivism, or clicktivism, has drawn strong responses from many people. Just searching \u201cslacktivism good or bad\u201d on the Internet provides news articles and other opinion pieces detailing the pros and cons of putting a patriotic filter over a Facebook photo. People who view clicktivism as a positive force in society point out that with a lot of media coverage, especially from friends and family, people can be moved to help out the victims for themselves. The problem with such activism practices, however, is that they expect people to simply see the reaction from their communities and start volunteering. Without any real guidance as to where they can put their time and money, they might talk a lot about helping but never get around to donating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">In fact, clicktivism often just stops at hashtags; in a study directed by Michigan State University, when people give intangible things to support victims of tragedy, they are less likely to give material goods such as money, or services like volunteering. By wearing pink socks in October, they believe they have \u201cfilled\u201d their kindness \u201cquota,\u201d and after having done something that they thought was good for their community, move on with their lives. Meanwhile, the people who have lost family members and property still do not have things they need to enter normal life again. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Even when it does move beyond attending vigils, this brand of activism only works as long as it is in the news cycle. The Flint water crisis is a very good example of this. The city\u2019s inhabitants have been drinking contaminated water from as far back as 2014, but did not receive any attention until it reached a state of emergency in January of this year. People were outraged at the incompetence of Flint\u2019s governors, and started petitions to arrest and impeach officials, uploaded videos expressing their anger and frustration with corruption in Michigan, and, yes, the hashtag #FlintWaterCrisis circulated for a while on the Internet. There were real donations this time, and for a few months church parking lots were bursting with pallets of bottled water. After the news was done with the story, the donations dried up. Nothing had been fixed; the water quality has not improved. The nature of hashtag activism is transient, and deeply depends on what the news is reporting. For change to really take place, it must be long-term and not superficial.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">On occasion, though, hashtag activism really does help. The ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, which offered social media users a chance to either donate $100 or pour a bucket of icy water on themselves, tore through media platforms in the summer of 2014. Many people opted to donate and torture themselves, and the challenge raised more than $115 million for a cure for ALS. With the money donated, researchers found a gene which contributed to many cases of the muscle-deteriorating disability. Sometimes, with the right combination of ice and media, change can happen.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>In the first few days of 2015, two men attacked the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo.

Review:  The Social Network","title_plain":"Movie Review:  The Social Network","content":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe Social Network\u201d was an odd bet for director David Fincher, who was more well known for his production of disturbing psychological thrillers. His first foray in the genre of drama resulted in the disastrous \u201cThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button.\u201d Fincher\u2019s impeccable direction worked against the film\u2019s bland script and soulless story. Fortunately, \u201cThe Social Network\u201d is the complete opposite. Fincher\u2019s cold, precise and austere direction harmonizes perfectly with screenwriter Aaron Sorkin\u2019s rapid fire, witty dialogue. The end result is something that is completely emblematic of its time and place, which is what makes \u201cThe Social Network\u201d one of the defining films of the 21st century.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">On the surface, the film is about Mark Zuckerberg and all the troubles he faced in his journey to create Facebook. However, such a synopsis does the film no justice because it is much more than just \u201cThe Facebook Movie.\u201d At its core, \u201cThe Social Network\u201d is a classic story with story elements that are as old as storytelling itself. Friendship, loyalty, jealousy, social structure and theft are all tribulations that humans have been writing about for thousands of years. And yet, the film still finds a clever way to incorporate those timeless story elements into a setting that is distinctly contemporary. The Internet hasn\u2019t so much altered or replaced human nature. Instead, the seemingly global communication network has amplified it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The film\u2019s nature is reflective of the modern world\u2019s calculated methods of communication. Much like how we self-edit and fine tune our texts for maximum efficiency, \u201cThe Social Network\u201d is curated such that every aspect is swift and flawless. Fincher\u2019s digital camera pans and tilts in an un-humanly glossy way. Every cut and line of dialogue is refined and locked in as tightly as possible. Actors do hundreds of takes for every scene, giving the editors plenty of footage to take apart and use. They even applied an invisible split-screen technique, where they would juxtapose two different takes of the same shot into one seamless shot in order to use the best elements of both shots.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The film\u2019s opening scene is a perfect representation of these elements coming together, especially the dialogue. Designing dialogue is one of the most difficult tasks in filmmaking, because the best dialogue feels fluid and natural but not pointless. Most importantly, great dialogue simultaneously reacts to and creates drama. In the opening scene, Zuckerberg is on a date with his fictional girlfriend Erica, played wonderfully by Rooney Mara. They talk about finals, clubs and geniuses in China until Erica becomes too frustrated with Zuckerberg\u2019s social ineptness. She insults him and leaves. Throughout the entire scene, the dialogue subconsciously teaches us about our characters until the scene crescendos to a punctuating climax that brings the film to life. Fincher told his actors not to just react to the dialogue they hear, but to take note of the implication in each word, so that even the simplest of lines are injected with meaning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> Fincher has always had an affinity for outsiders, being one himself, and Zuckerberg is no exception. However, this is the first time that Fincher has placed his exploration of weirdos in something subtler and more grounded in reality. Unlike Tyler Durden\u2019s terrorist attacks on credit card buildings and capitalism in \u201cFight Club,\u201d Zuckerberg\u2019s revolution succeeded. With Facebook, he completely changed the social dynamic. Elite clubs and Harvard are old money. Zuckerberg is the future. Every Facebook user has the power to be the president of an elite club. No longer can the wealthy and privileged dominate in the same way. The film also hints at a psychological shift created by the information age, a new breed of impersonality. Facebook is a complete paradox, granting people the aura of intimacy while still maintaining the comfort of distance. Every person we communicate with has become a packet of information. In the film, Zuckerberg almost has a binary personality. Either you have information he wants or he doesn\u2019t care.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Despite Zuckerberg\u2019s coldness and unapproachability, Fincher and Sorkin, along with Jesse Eisenberg\u2019s nuanced performance, prevent his character from becoming one-dimensional. Every time he destroys a relationship, there is a quiver of regret in his lips. Ultimately, he\u2019s still human who grieves and desires. The film\u2019s ending plays out like that of \u201cCitizen Kane.\u201d Zuckerberg is Charles Foster Kane and the desire for human connection is his Rosebud. And yet, all that\u2019s left is his empire and the refresh button.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>\u201cThe Social Network\u201d was an odd bet for director David Fincher, who was more well known for his production of disturbing psychological thrillers.

English instructor Tyler Caldwell owns Kip, but he frequently spends time in Webster Hall with his owner\u2019s twin sister, history instructor Alexa Caldwell. At his home in Soule Hall, Kip enjoys playing fetch and snacking on discarded pizza crusts in the common room. Although pizza is a favorite of Kip\u2019s, Alexa Caldwell said that really \u201canything he can find on the floor\u201d will do.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">More than anything, Kip enjoys being one with nature. \u201cHe loves to run through the woods. He also loves our parents\u2019 house in Vermont because he can be outside all day,\u201d Tyler Caldwell said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When asked what other animals Kip likes to play with on campus, Alexa Caldwell replied, \u201cThe boys in Soule Hall.\u201d Kip does have a few canine friends on campus including Pete, English instructor Kelly Flynn\u2019s dog, and two features from the last \u201cDog Spotlight,\u201d Dolly Bubbles (owned by Patty Burke) and Oliver (owned by Lundy Smith). However, if he were given the choice, Kip would much rather spend time with humans. \u201cHe is an ideal boarding school dog,\u201d Tyler Caldwell said. \u201cHe loves seeing the students on campus.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\">Ollie &amp; Luna<\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-16838\" src=\"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/LIFE-ollieluna.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/LIFE-ollieluna.jpg 240w, https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/LIFE-ollieluna-53x70.jpg 53w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-16840\" src=\"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/OllieLuna-life-photo-2.png\" width=\"226\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/OllieLuna-life-photo-2.png 181w, https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/OllieLuna-life-photo-2-40x70.png 40w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Ollie&#8217;s Breed: Terrier Mix<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Luna&#8217;s Breed: Black Lab and Chow Chow<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Owner: Jennifer Marx Asch<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Two more fluffy friends here on campus are Ollie and Luna. They are owned by Rabbi Marx Asch, and they live in Dunbar Hall. Both Ollie and Luna are rescue dogs, so Marx Asch does not know their exact age, but guesses they are both around eight years old. Ollie is a terrier mix and Luna is a black lab and chow chow mix.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Ollie and Luna\u2019s favorite thing to do around Exeter is \u201cwalk the South Quad, especially near Elm Street to look for discarded ice cream cones,\u201d Marx Asch said. She adds that \u201coutside Wentworth and Webster is usually good for a pizza crust.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Marx Asch believes that having a dog on campus is different from having a dog away from school because here the dogs cannot be left unleashed inside of a yard with an invisible fence. They have to be walked. She said this leads to \u201cnever-ending arguments amongst my children about who\u2019s turn it is to walk the dogs.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Ollie\u2019s favorite snacks are practically anything on the ground. \u201cHe loves eating cheese wrappers, paper napkins, empty peanut butter jars and other trash,\u201d she said. \u201cHe resembles a tater tot. Although, for a couch potato, he loves to play ball.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Marx Asch added that the crumbs on the floor of the Dunbar common room satisfy Luna and Ollie\u2019s voracious appetites. \u201cLuna will stand at the door of our faculty apartment and whimper to go out into the common room when she hears students out there,\u201d Marx Asch explained. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Luna is also great at being a dog therapist. \u201cWhenever I have a sad student talking with me in my study, Luna cuddles with her on my couch. Rubbing Luna\u2019s belly makes you feel better.\u201d She said that Ollie is \u201creally sweet with his family, and a great snuggler.\u201d These two sweet Dun-dogs\u2014dogs who live in Dunbar Hall\u2014brighten up both their dorm and the Exeter campus!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Kip Breed: Border Collie Owner: Tyler Caldwell Our first featured dog this week is Kip, a six-year-old border collie.

Trimble \u201980 Awarded John Phillips Award","title_plain":"Dr. Trimble \u201980 Awarded John Phillips Award","content":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Academy Trustees and the Executive Committee of the General Alumni honored Cornelia \u201cConnie\u201d Liu Trimble \u201980 with the 2016 John Phillips Award during last Friday\u2019s assembly. Trimble is a doctor who has been recognized for her contributions to the field of immunotherapy and her work in cancer research and prevention. The assembly saw three standing ovations\u2014two before she spoke about her experience living a \u201cHarkness life\u201d in a world without Harkness. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The award is given annually to an Exonian who exemplifies John Phillip\u2019s ideals of goodness and knowledge and who has contributed to the welfare of the Exeter community and the world since his or her graduation. According to Mitch Bradbury \u201978, chair of the 2016 Awards Committee, Trimble stood out from the candidate pool because of her \u201cwonderful work\u201d in medical science over many years. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As Director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Cervical Dysplasia and Professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Pathology and Oncology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Trimble\u2019s research focuses on developing and evaluating interventions to prevent cancers associated with persistent HPV. She is one of very few practicing physicians that conduct research. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Trimble never imagined going to boarding school, but when a family friend showed her an Exeter brochure, she was immediately interested. When she arrived at the Academy, she said that being an Asian American woman made her feel like she stood out, but also gave her motivation to prove her value and to try to work harder than her peers. After Exeter, she studied civil engineering and international relations at Princeton University at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. She then obtained a medical degree from Vanderbilt University, before going on to earn a master\u2019s degree at the writing seminar at Johns Hopkins University. While there, she met surgeon and professor Donald Woodruff, who sparked her interest in pathology. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">She accepted a pathology internship and residency at Cornell University. In 2015, Trimble became the seventh woman in Johns Hopkins\u2019 history to hold the title of full professor of pathology and obstetrics.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Bradbury said that this year\u2019s Awards Committee, which was made up of 13 alumni ranging in graduation year from 1954 to 2004, met in Boston in January and spent a significant amount of time deliberating and discussing the candidates. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He acknowledged that the process was difficult because the school is \u201cblessed with so many great alumni,\u201d and each year only one wins the prestigious award. They thought about the individuals and the issues that each has worked to change or fix. \u201cConnie was just an individual who deserved to be this year\u2019s winner,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\"><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;I had been flying way below the radar, which was a survival strategy. Then there I was, way not below the radar.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In February, Trimble gave an assembly in which she talked about her work in cancer research. As she was leaving the Academy Building, she received a phone call from Bradbury. He told her that she was to be the recipient of the 2016 John Phillips Award. In response she said, \u201cDude, for real? Are you kidding me? Is this a prank call?\u201d She felt validated and said that no recognition could have meant more to her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> \u201cI had been plugging along, doing my thing, trying to figure out how to get a person\u2019s immune system get rid of HPV pre-cancers,\u201d she said. \u201cI did not think that my work was \u2018sexy\u2019 or ground-breaking; I thought it was common sense. I had been flying way below the radar, which was a survival strategy. Then there I was, way not below the radar.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">After the Academy sent out an email to alumni about her recognition, Trimble heard from several people around the world\u2014some who she had never met, some who she had not talked to since graduation. She said in light of the recent sexual misconduct cases, people were relieved to hear good news from the Academy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI realized that I wanted to remind everyone of what was fundamental and good about Phillips Exeter Academy,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of our common goals is to make PEA a safe place for students.\u201d She then decided to give her acceptance speech not about her work but rather as a talk with the students, finding it important to tell them how much they are loved and cared for as members of the community. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As a member of an immigrant family, lower Adrian Kyle Venzon felt moved by her story and shared some of the experiences that she described during her assembly. He thought she was a good choice for the award because the work she does actively makes a difference in people\u2019s lives. \u201cShe is a role model for us because she came from the same place: Exeter,\u201d he said. \u201cShe calls this place her home, and it is ours too. She is one of us and that\u2019s what makes her so inspirational.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Upper Maya Kim, who said she was moved to tears of joy during the assembly, also found Trimble to be an inspiration. She felt comforted by Trimble\u2019s idea that \u201cyou don\u2019t have to have everything figured out,\u201d since she is someone who has been extremely successful in her field. Kim thought Trimble truly shows what it means to be an Exonian in the \u201creal world\u201d as she is using what she learned from Harkness to contribute to cancer research. \u201cShe literally taught herself immunology,\u201d Kim said. \u201cIf that\u2019s not dedication, I don\u2019t what is. She is a woman in science, and she shows us all that we can do it too despite how hard it might be.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As an Asian American, lower Hanna Pak felt inspired by Trimble, all her accomplishments and her positive outlook on life. Pak said the assembly was amazing and that Trimble connected with the Exeter student body. \u201cSeeing how passionate she was about her work made me hopeful for the future,\u201d Pak said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While Trimble was at Exeter, there were not many Asian students or girls, so in her high-level math class taught by former mathematics instructor Rick Parris, she was an outlier. Trimble looked up to Parris as a mentor. Coordinator of Academic Support Services Pamela Parris, Rick Parris\u2019 wife, recalled times when Trimble and her male math classmates would come to her faculty apartment in Merrill Hall to do homework together. Parris said that when the homework was done, the boys would leave, but Trimble would stay and help her feed their baby. Then the two would put the baby in the crib and read stories to her. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhen she was finally asleep, Connie and I literally crawled out of the room,\u201d Parris said. But by then it would be close to check-in and Trimble would rush back to her dorm, screaming \u201cSprinting time!\u201d as Parris vividly remembers. Since she graduated, Trimble has come back regularly to visit faculty families who share similar memories with her. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cShe cares about everyone she works with, and I can see how much she loves to connect with fellow Exonians,\u201d Parris said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cShe is a listener, and that\u2019s part of why she is so successful. She doesn\u2019t make it all about her; she shares the workload and the triumphs with others.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>The Academy Trustees and the Executive Committee of the General Alumni honored Cornelia \u201cConnie\u201d Liu Trimble \u201980 with the 2016 John Phillips Award during last Friday\u2019s assembly.

Polo Edges Out Loomis: Big Red Heads into NE Championships with 12-1 Record","title_plain":"Water Polo Edges Out Loomis: Big Red Heads into NE Championships with 12-1 Record","content":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Boys\u2019 water polo continued to display its dominance this past weekend, beating Loomis Chaffee 8-7 at home. As a result, Bear Polo has now cemented its number two ranking going into Interschols.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Exeter boys had been tracking Loomis\u2019 record prior to the game, and slid into the pool understanding that their opponents would be tough to beat. \u201cWe knew they were going to be our closest competition yet,\u201d co-captain and senior Liam Oakley said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The boys went in with a solemn attitude, understanding that this would not be an easy win and that the team\u2019s regional ranking was at stake. \u201cWe are normally a pretty rowdy and obnoxious team, but as we got closer and closer to Saturday, we got nervous,\u201d Oakley said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The captains helped to mitigate the nerves somewhat with their leadership. \u201cWe were nervous but the captains kept the team under control and we had confidence,\u201d upper Avery Giles said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, the team had also faced a rough week of practice prior to the game and were missing two starters. \u201cWe knew this game was going to be a battle, from start to finish,\u201d Oakley said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cWe are normally a pretty rowdy and obnoxious team, but as we got closer and closer to Saturday, we got nervous.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Although Loomis showed their strength in the first quarter, things looked up for the Exeter boys from the second quarter. Starting the second quarter down 1-0, Bear Polo quickly picked it up, scoring early off a man-up play. The half ended with one of the goalies, senior and co-captain JP Mullins, pulling off a full court shot, an unusual move that \u201cgave [the] team some extra momentum,\u201d according to upper Taylor Walshe, causing the team to finish the half up 4-2.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Loomis switched strategies for the second half, utilizing a M-drop defense, but the Loomis boys were no match to Exeter\u2019s tried and tested press defense. It was this defense, described by Oakley as \u201crelentless,\u201d that made the difference in the game. \u201cOur defense was ultimately what won us the game,\u201d Walshe said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Exeter\u2019s offense also proved to be formidable. Upper Harril Saunders managed to get three goals in a row in during the second half, sniping in from the perimeter of the pool to beat Loomis back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Towards the end of the game, Bear Polo let down their guard, having secured their position. This allowed Loomis to come within a goal of the Exeter goals, leading to the final score of 8-7. Walshe noted that the team has had a tendency to become too complacent throughout the season. \u201cThis is no common occurrence as we have had this trouble in many of our past game,\u201d he said. \u201cKeeping up the intensity until the final whistle and not getting complacent is something we need to work on.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With Bear Polo having played their last regular season game against Andover on Wednesday, the team is now fully focused on Interschols, hoping to beat Brunswick, the one team that managed to defeat them this season, to claim the New England title. Interschols will be held at Hotchkiss over E\/a weekend, Nov. 12 through Nov. 13.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Boys\u2019 water polo continued to display its dominance this past weekend, beating Loomis Chaffee 8-7 at home.

to Decay, Porter House Is Demolished","title_plain":"Due to Decay, Porter House Is Demolished","content":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Situated across Main Street and tucked quaintly among the trees, the demolished remains of an old New England home lie. Porter House has served as faculty housing at Phillips Exeter for almost an entire century, and was recently razed due to the rising cost of structural renovations. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Porter House has been unoccupied since the 2012-2013 school year; its inhabitants included English instructor Michelle Dionne. Dionne lived there with her family until the school asked her to relocate four years ago. She noted its architectural character and reminisced about the many happy years that she spent in Porter House with her family. \u201cIt was a charming old New England house, and I was really sad to see it bulldozed,\u201d she said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Dionne was not just sad about having to move, but she expressed grief that such a historic site could not be preserved or maintained for future residents. \u201cI understand the economics,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it\u2019s too bad that the school doesn\u2019t see fit to restore its old houses, even when it is expensive to do so. It\u2019s a shame to see all these bits of history and New England character lost.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The earliest photographs of Porter House date back to 1907, when it was located on Main Street near the administrative buildings. In 1931, Porter House was moved to make room for the construction of Jeremiah Smith Hall.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">&#8220;It\u2019s a shame to see all these bits of history and New England character lost.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the 1960s, the house was moved once more, along with a number of other houses, to make room for Main Street Hall and Ewald Hall. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The house\u2019s history is extensive, and some say that it hosted famous politicians as they passed through Exeter. Dionne said that a neighbor told her that President Dwight D. Eisenhower once slept there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Since the late 1960s, the structural support of the Porter House basement has been deemed inadequate. Facilities coordinator Anita Bailey, who is knowledgeable about the history of school buildings, discussed the house\u2019s structural defects: \u201cThe costs to rectify the structural deficiencies would make the cost of the renovation prohibitive,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When the house was demolished, the school was very mindful of preserving some of its historical aspects. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe were able to salvage a number of elements from the house for donation to Habitat for Humanity,\u201d Bailey said. Habitat for Humanity is a global, nonprofit organization that seeks to provide affordable housing for families and accepts donations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While there is not an official future plan in place for the land where Porter house once stood, it will likely become used for faculty condominiums. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As for Porter House, its century-long lifespan has finally come to end, and new history will begin again on the grounds of its remains.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Situated across Main Street and tucked quaintly among the trees, the demolished remains of an old New England home lie.

When she was five-years-old, her mother asked if she wanted to play a sport, but Wilson chose dance because she could read in between classes. \u201cAfter a while, I just started to love it,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI\u2019ve been dancing in one way or another ever since.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Before coming to Exeter, Wilson considered herself to be a more \u201ctechnical\u201d dancer: she took ballet, jazz and modern classes every week. Now, Wilson is involved with many different dance clubs on campus, where she pushes herself to try new styles. \u201cI\u2019m not very girly or graceful in the ballet sense, but I am more hip-hop than anything else,\u201d Wilson said. She explained that during her time at Exeter, she has developed choreography skills, creativity and has become more experienced technically. Wilson attributed her capacity for creating to the time she has to practice. \u201cI am always learning from my fellow dancers and the dance teachers here, and I have lots of time to daydream about choreo and bring it to life; see what works, see what doesn\u2019t,\u201d Wilson said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">&#8220;It feels good that I was chosen for this position, because I know that people support my ideas and think I am good enough at what I do to lead a group of people.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Wilson dances for POMS, Exeter\u2019s cheerleading team. She is a member of Illuminosity, a club that mixes dance, martial arts and fire. \u201cI even tried breakdancing for a term,\u201d Wilson said. She is also the co-head of Imani, a hip hop group, and of Precision, the female step team. Being a co-head is not a position that Wilson takes lightly. Wilson dedicates her time and energy to experimenting with inventive ideas and moves and picking good songs. \u201cI don\u2019t want each performance to just be okay,\u201d Wilson explained. \u201cI want it to be really good.\u201d She described her style of teaching dance as one that focuses on repetition. \u201cI drill and drill and refine forever before I am satisfied with something,\u201d Wilson said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Wilson sees the rewards of her hard work whenever her clubs perform. \u201cIt\u2019s such a nice experience having an idea in your head and seeing it in real life,\u201d Wilson elaborated. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying being a co-head so much.\u201d Wilson continued, adding that if she hadn\u2019t spent a year abroad in China, she would\u2019ve enjoyed being a co-head much earlier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Wilson was voted in by the co-heads who came before her. When asked how she felt about her appointment, Wilson said, \u201cIt feels good that I was chosen for this position, because I know that people support my ideas and think I am good enough at what I do to lead a group of people.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Hannah McKay is one of those people who admires Wilson\u2019s skills and leadership. \u201cKesi is an amazing dancer,\u201d McKay said. \u201cShe presents a confidence which makes it so [that] no matter what movement she is doing, the audience is completely drawn into her.\u201d McKay and Wilson are both in charge of Imani, and create the audition routines for eager newcomers. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">McKay recalled the process of auditioning earlier this year. \u201cWe decided we\u2019d watch a video of a dance we liked and then teach each other the one we picked,\u201d she explained. Wilson and McKay taught each other both dances in less than 15 minutes each, something very difficult to achieve. They planned to teach both dances within two hours, but could only get halfway through their first dance because they hadn\u2019t realized how challenging the dance was. \u201cWe are both very creative and can pick up choreography very quickly,\u201d McKay said. \u201cWhen you put Kesi and I together, the things we come up with can seem impossible.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">McKay credited Wilson\u2019s ability to memorize routines very quickly to the \u201cintrinsic harmony between mind and body,\u201d which results in a fluidity of movement and coordination. \u201cShe is what you\u2019d call a \u2018natural,\u201d McKay said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Jaden Wood can also attest to Wilson\u2019s remarkable talent. Wood and Wilson have both participated in Dance Company and taken dance classes together, and are both active members of POMS. \u201cKesi has always brought so much energy to dance,\u201d Wood said. \u201cNo matter how she\u2019s feeling, whether she pulled an all-nighter or if she\u2019s just plain stressed, she leaves it all behind when she walks into the studio.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Wood described Wilson as \u201cfunny\u201d and a \u201cpositive influence\u201d on the dance community at Exeter. She also praised Wilson for how seriously she approaches dance, despite her light-hearted demeanor. \u201cKesi is extremely intelligent,\u201d Wood said. \u201cShe can always be counted on for advice, an educated opinion and a game plan when we\u2019re in times of trouble.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>For senior Kesi Wilson, dance is more than just a hobby.

He signed up for several clubs at his first club night, but instead of \u201cwhittling down\u201d that number over the year, he \u201cjust kind of stuck with them\u201d because he loves everything that he does. It was during his first year at the Academy that he realized his love for social service, debate and business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Goyal\u2019s interest in computer science began in seventh grade. He was bored at math camp and began playing on his graphing calculator. That\u2019s how he accidentally taught himself how to program and code. Among his various computer science related clubs at Exeter, Goyal has also helped run an annual hackathon called \u201cHackExeter.\u201d The hackathon is one of the only technology competitions in the area that is geared toward middle schoolers. Senior Eric Tang, a close friend who has worked with Goyal in both debate, HackExeter and ESSO Junior Computing Club, said that he admires everything about him. \u201cHe\u2019s always just incredibly funny, curious and insightful,\u201d Tang said. \u201cHe\u2019s always there to talk to whenever I\u2019m going through a rough patch or just want someone to talk to.\u201dWhile he arrived at Exeter as a new lower knowing that math was one of his strengths, Goyal made a conscious decision to expand his interests during his first year here.

He also described him as \u201cexceptionally curious,\u201d and said when he discovers something new he will pour in tremendous amounts of time and energy to learn about it. \u201cI\u2019m always telling him to go to sleep when he\u2019s coding some brilliant project at 3 a.m.,\u201d Tang said. He added that Goyal brings those same qualities to HackExeter and ESSO.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As the off-campus coordinator of ESSO, Goyal has embraced not only helping the Exeter community, but also the local community. He said that the ESSO board is the group of people who helps Exonians meet, structure and organize events with the community. They do this to help Exonians get involved in and out of the Exeter bubble. For him, ESSO is \u201cfellowship with the community and with more than just Exonians.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Connie Cai, a co-president of ESSO, described Goyal as one of the most genuine people she has ever met. She recalled times when he would go out of his way to make her day better\u2014whether it be through surprising her with chocolate or sending her a postcard over the summer. As a leader, she said he is dedicated, passionate and never accepts the status quo or anything as \u201cgood enough.\u201d She added that he is always looking for a new and creative solution. \u201cI really admire how much he puts into his work, and how genuinely dedicated and passionate he is about his favorite things,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In addition to all his clubs, Goyal is also an active resident of Soule Hall as a proctor and Student Listener. Health instructor and dorm faculty Elizabeth Hurley said that Goyal understands at a deep level all his fellow dormmates, helping younger students adjust to Exeter and older students cope with stress.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cHe has kind of been a proctor in my eyes for the last two years,\u201d she said. \u201cNow as an official proctor, [he is] that link between faculty and the students in the dorm: letting faculty know if we should be aware of something.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The lowerclassmen in Soule agreed that Goyal is an essential asset in the dorm. Lower Adrian Venzon said he talks to him about anything. \u201cHis room is always open and I always feel welcome,\u201d he said. \u201cI will definitely miss him after graduation, and I will miss his hugs the most.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lower Charlie Neuhaus added that Goyal is a consistent source of advice. \u201cYou can tell that he really cares about everyone in the dorm, and that makes him a really good proctor,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The broader Exeter community also finds solace in Goyal\u2019s presence. Upper Alexis Gorfine admired him for his ability to remain optimistic despite all the stresses of senior year. \u201cAnd not only is he a happy person himself, but he is also always encouraging and cheering up others,\u201d she said. Senior Kaitlyn Kang agreed that Goyal can brighten anyone\u2019s day. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI remember once I had mentioned briefly to him that I was going to pull an all-nighter, and the next morning he tracked me down and made me tea and gave me a nice big hug,\u201d Kang said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Abigail Africa said that Goyal is exceptional because he is generous in giving of himself, from helping with homework to college essays\u2014everything with him is personal. \u201cHe always takes the time to tell you his thoughts, and I love the way he thinks,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething about it is so balanced. There\u2019s no other way to put it. It\u2019s logical and yet completely empathetic.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Africa recalled a time when he bought her \u201cpost-traumatic burgers\u201d after she took the ACT. \u201cHe\u2019s an enduring friend who\u2019s inclined to serving others before he asks for anything himself,\u201d she said, and added that he rarely asks for things. \u201cHe\u2019s just kind, and he\u2019s good at thinking and talking and pretty much everything else, and he puts other people first consistently. I think all of this is why he fits in so well to the Exeter community,\u201d Africa said. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Look for senior Aivant Goyal, and you\u2019ll probably find him at a club meeting.

From the Students Abroad in France","content":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sixteen seniors are spending their fall term abroad in Grenoble, France. They write to <i>The Exonian<\/i> about their experiences, diet and thoughts on French culture. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Hello from across the Atlantic! Coucou! Salutations de Grenoble! For those of you who are at all interested in hearing about our trip, here are a couple of our favorite moments from our stay here. And for those of you who aren\u2019t interested, we\u2019re sacrificing our kilts for this so read it anyway. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Grenoble is a small city (a little smaller than we were expecting, but that makes it harder to get lost) outside of Lyon, surrounded by the beautiful Alps. Our main focus here is to improve our French and immerse ourselves in the French culture\u2014one baguette at a time. We each live with a host family, some in the heart of the city and others in the beautiful countryside. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While we learn the language in class, we are given more valuable lessons in our homes here. Our host families are very generous\u2014often proposing hikes on the weekends, inviting us to meet their friends and teaching us the necessities of French life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Our school here is situated along the river \u201cL\u2019Is\u00e8re\u201d and from the classroom windows we have a lovely view of the mountains encircling Grenoble, famous for their production of Chartreuse\u2014an herbal liquor manufactured by local monks. We take our classes at a local university called \u201cUniversite Inter-Ages du Dauphine.\u201d You might be confused with the words Inter-Ages; we were too. After timidly walking into our new school building the first day, excited by the prospect of meeting French students, we were pleasantly surprised to find ourselves surrounded by seniors of a different sense. We share the hallways with French retirees studying any number of things from Hieroglyphics to Spanish. It is sometimes amusing to hear an English lesson going on in the room next to us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">On class days, we study French literature, language, culture, film and art. Thursdays are known as \u201cexcursion days,\u201d when we explore various art around the city and the towns around us. We\u2019ve also taken excursions to Lyon, Aix-en-Provence and Paris. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The visit to Paris has been a highlight for us. Though we left Grenoble under the veil of taking the ACT, our trip comprised of much more. Our youth hostel was in the historic Marais district, located in a part of 3<sup>e<\/sup> and 4<sup>e <\/sup>arrondissements on the right bank of the Seine. We loved strolling the narrow alleyways of the Jewish quarter, as well as enjoying some of the innovation of the up-and-coming district; namely the actress Scarlett Johansson\u2019s pop-up popcorn shop. Our days were filled with fabulous museum visits, guided tours of historic neighborhoods and even an organ concert at the famous Notre Dame cathedral.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We spent a day exploring the Palace of Versailles, which lies a few metro stops outside of the city. While the interior of Versailles was ornate and smothered in gold filings and cherub statues as expected, we found the gardens to be a pleasant surprise. We were given two hours to explore the manicured estate, where we found classical music playing at every turn from hidden speakers in the greenery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This weekend we\u2019ll be traveling to Geneva, Switzerland, to take the SAT. We considered ourselves to be far more cultured than when we arrived. Our appreciation of art and culture has blossomed, so get ready Exonians, campus will be much more colorful upon our return\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Keep in mind, apart from our long days of study, we\u2019ve been engaging in classic French activities such as eating bread, eating cheese and eating croissants! We will all be returning to campus a little more plump than usual, just preparing ourselves for the chilly New England winter that awaits. Our claims of \u201cdiet szn starting Monday\u201d haven\u2019t exactly worked out. But we aren\u2019t too worried, seeing as we have three more Mondays left to cut the carbs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Aside from getting a sports credit from trudging up the Bastille, an ancient military fortification overlooking the city, on a gorgeous fall day, we have gotten steps under our belts after exploring the bountiful gardens of Versailles, dodging through excited tourists to enter the Louvre and running to catch the bus. Jenny Hunt and Isabel Bitman even walked 40,000 steps each one day in Paris!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In all seriousness though, rest assured that we miss all of you slaving away back there in the bubble. But all the same, if Trump wins, don\u2019t expect to see us again for the next four years.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Sixteen seniors are spending their fall term abroad in Grenoble, France.

Compete in the Head of the Charles","title_plain":"Exonians Compete in the Head of the Charles","content":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">10 students represented Exeter at the 52nd Head of the Charles Regatta last weekend. Uppers Francis Baviera Maloney and JP Kim and seniors Stone Sulley, Jack Telman and Bennett Levy represented the Exeter crew team in the youth men\u2019s club fours race while seniors Maya Blake, Honor Clements, Zoe Marshall, upper Marie Leighton McCall and lower Christine Baker did so in the youth women\u2019s counterpart. The boys placed 24th in a race of 84 teams, while the girls placed 43rd in a race of 85.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cI\u2019m pretty excited about this four because they row together really really well; they have excellent connection, and they enjoy each other\u2019s company a lot and have fun while they\u2019re rowing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Over 11,000 athletes compete in the Head of the Charles each year, with hundreds of thousands of people coming to the banks of the river to watch. The regatta features rowers and boats of all types with divisions for youth, collegiate, elite, masters and paralympic crews. Teams travel from all over the world to compete. The course is three miles long, from Boston University\u2019s DeWolfe boathouse to just before Northeastern University\u2019s Henderson boathouse.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Going into the competition, both teams were excited and looking forward to strong finishes. Only the girls\u2019 team had competed last year, as the boys had failed to earn a guaranteed entry the year before. \u201cWe want to improve on last year\u2019s finish,\u201d head girl\u2019s coach and classical languages instructor Sally Morris said. The girls hoped to place in the top 30, which would allow them to have a higher bow number, which is indicative of a crew\u2019s seeding, in next year\u2019s competition. \u201cOur bow marker is 51, and we want to get into the twenties,\u201d Morris added.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Both crews prepared extensively to ensure that Exeter was sending its best crews to the competition. Team members on both teams underwent extensive seat racing, in which two rowers are switched in lineups to determine who makes a certain boat go faster, during the selection process. The boys varied their practices, doing a mix of shorter and longer pieces, to help the rowers shift from the shorter, 1500 meter races of the spring season, to the longer \u201chead\u201d style of crew racing. \u201cThe race is going to take over 17 minutes which is very different from 1500 meters in the spring,\u201d the boys\u2019 team head coach and instructor in chemistry Albert Leger said. The girls had double training sessions twice a week, outside of the club crew meeting schedule, and employed a workout regimen that graduated in toughness as the regatta date approached. The girls were optimistic going into the race, due to the strong connection between the four rowers. \u201cI\u2019m pretty excited about this four because they row together really really well; they have excellent connection, and they enjoy each other\u2019s company a lot and have fun while they\u2019re rowing,\u201d Morris said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While the boys faced some setbacks during the race, they were pleased with their finish. Although their raw time would have placed them at 17th, they incurred a five second penalty after going over the buoy lines used to mark the course. In addition, one of the crews they started behind, St. Peter\u2019s, refused to yield and allow them to pass, which slowed the boys down. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Kim was frustrated because he felt that the boys could have finished with a higher ranking. \u201cWe could&#8217;ve done better &#8230; The conditions we rowed in were not ideal, and other crews did not follow the rules, causing our boat to slow down.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Nevertheless, the boys enjoyed the regatta. \u201cToday was a day full of adrenaline and anxiety as we prepared for the race, and just hectic all around, and we as a boat loved every minute of it,\u201d Telman said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Leger expressed pride in the boys and all the hard work they had put in. \u201cThe guys have put in a lot of work, they\u2019ve improved a lot, and I\u2019m really proud of them,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Telman said that carrying Exeter\u2019s banner at such a prestigious event was especially significant to him, as he had worked his way up to the top four over his years at Exeter. \u201cAs a senior in the boat it was a very meaningful experience for me to represent Exeter at such an amazing event,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The girls battled difficult conditions, racing early in the morning on Sunday in water topped with white caps. Marshall emphasized the importance of maintaining focus despite the tough weather and any other distractions that may come up. \u201cDon&#8217;t become frantic when the boat is off set&#8230;The key is to stay with your boat, even when you pass bridges with people screaming, stay calm, and get your blade in the water,\u201d Marshall said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The girls were pleased with their overall finish, having moved up to 43rd from 51st in the rankings, but would like to have placed higher. They exhibited tenacity and fortitude as they battled the weather during the race which lasted over 22 minutes. \u201cWe nailed the turns and passed two boats. We definitely wanted to have placed a little better, but we raced hard and came together as a boat through the bad conditions,\u201d Baker said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Members of the crews were excited to attend a regatta of such a scope as the Charles, not just to compete in but also to watch and experience the event as a whole.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Baker was glad that she reunited with friends from across the country who were also competing in or watching the Charles. \u201cI got to see a lot of friends from around the country that I met in different crew programs over the summer,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Kim was excited to be around so many others who were involved in the world of rowing. He had not realized the scope of people who did crew prior to the regatta. \u201cThe fact that so many people shared the same interest in rowing was eye-opening,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Telman too enjoyed being fully immersed himself in the world of rowing and surrounding himself with rowers of all different kinds who share his love for the sport. \u201cIt is really humbling to watch the Head of the Charles as a rower because I realize how many people also love the sport, from novices to Olympians,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are over 250,000 spectators and over 15,000 rowers [at the Charles] all celebrating a unique and similar part of our lives that we share a passion and love for. What more can you ask for than that?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>10 students represented Exeter at the 52nd Head of the Charles Regatta last weekend.

Ever since her debut in Paris in 1980, Kawakubo has blurred the line between fashion and art, challenging people\u2019s view on fashion and clothing. In her Fall 2012 collection, Rei wanted to make a statement about fashion in the internet age, so she made the models walk in robotic steps and made her flamboyant dresses and capes appear 2-D, making it seem like the models were a paper doll. Now that we know the theme of next year\u2019s Costume Institute, we can\u2019t wait to see what the a-list celebrities are going to wear to the MET Gala, which is the annual opening event for the exhibition that is the equivalent of the Oscars for the fashion world! <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Now the temperature is cold enough for us to whisk out our fall coats, we have a list of fall 2016 coats for you!

Style the shearling coat with a sweater, pair of culottes and loafers, and you\u2019ll be ready to go! Spring colors are also a big outerwear trend this fall. It is totally appropriate and quite trendy for you to wear bright spring colors during this fall. Love feeling like you are walking around with a huge blanket keeping you warm?

We get a glimpse at the faces of these recruits and see fear, laughter, annoyance, anger and apathy, all in the course of half a minute. It\u2019s a bouncy, fun opener, and one that sets in motion the juxtapositions of tone that last throughout the film, because it abruptly cuts to the same recruits being beaten down by their drill sergeant only a minute later. \u201cFull Metal Jacket,\u201d directed by Stanley Kubrick, is a movie in two main acts. In the first, we follow two recruits, Joker and Pyle, through basic training; in the second, we see Joker enter the field as war correspondent during the Tet Offensive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Like most art that deals with Vietnam, \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d is told through surrealist methods: Apart from sparse flashes of lucidity, the movie plays out as though the characters are moving through a dream. There are times when the acting is ridiculous, sounding as if the actors are reading their lines from a teleprompter, and it\u2019s puzzling that Kubrick didn\u2019t get his actors to do another take on these scenes. With his reputation as an exacting and meticulous director, maybe he intended it. In any case, the stilted acting furthers the sludgy, dreamlike feel of the film, and is remarkably unnerving. In contrast to this, R. Lee Ermey\u2019s portrayal of Hartman, the first act\u2019s drill sergeant, is electrifying. Ermey is a former drill sergeant, and this comes through with his biting insults (most of which were ad-libbed) and abusive tactics while training his character\u2019s recruits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The movie is complimented by its strong soundtrack, drawing from the pop hits of the time period. It\u2019s lacking the standard \u201cFortunate Sun,\u201d but it works nonetheless. In one of the more ridiculous scenes later in the movie, Joker and his cameraman connect with a platoon of Marines, of one which poses for a picture with a dead Vietcong he had been keeping. The whole scene plays out to the psychedelic, looping tune of \u201cWooly Bully.\u201d It\u2019s scenes like these that demonstrate the main thrust of the film: the effect Vietnam had on na\u00efve and reckless boys thrust into the jungle. The characters speak in the lingo of high schoolers, constantly trying to say something that might out-shock the last.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;Full Metal Jacket&#8221; came out in 1987, 12 years after the Fall of Saigon. This is one of the movie\u2019s main failings\u2014by that time, there wasn\u2019t much that hadn\u2019t been explored about the Vietnam war. Some of the \u201cset piece\u201d scenes in the movie fall flat as they\u2019re reworked versions of tropes we have already seen. That being said, Kubrick finds ways to explore these themes in a way that keeps them interesting\u2014if only visually so. The film often feels like a highlight reel of beautiful scenes, more like a book of short stories than a novel. This isn\u2019t exactly the worst criticism that can be levied at a movie, though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The movie ends on the image of Joker and his patrolling burning city of Hu\u1ebf. They\u2019re singing the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse song, strolling through what looks like hell. Maybe Full Metal Jacket covers pre-trodden ground, but you can\u2019t deny it does so in style.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>I love the opening of \u201cFull Metal Jacket.\u201d Backed by a folk tune lamenting the trip to Vietnam, we\u2019re led through short clips of recruits having their heads sheared for basic training.

Last Saturday was one of the most aggressive conditions that the Exeter Girls Cross Country team has competed in this season- including the hills of NMH and the mobs of runners at Codfish Bowl. Yet again, despite mother nature\u2019s wrath, Exeter prevailed and took home another win. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In contrast to some of their previous competition, Deerfield posed a greater challenge purely due to the talent on their team. Deerfield has been known for their highly competitive and historically successful cross country program, so the girls came prepared to meet this challenge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Exeter expected a battle out of Deerfield, and that\u2019s what they got. Deerfield\u2019s top runner was a prospective Exeter student, but instead chose to go to Deerfield Academy. Senior Joanna Papadakis said, \u201cShe was good competition for our top runners, but both Christine [Hu] and Yoshiko [Lynch] ran great races and she ended up placing third.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Although the talent from Deerfield was fierce, there was another factor aiding the Exeter runners. This was their first home race in a while, which was highly advantageous. Knowing your own course can be very helpful, especially considering the given weather conditions. Upper Kate Lu explained, \u201cDeerfield was strong as a team and they had a lot of great runners, but since we were racing at home we had the advantage.\u201d Because of this, parts of the race were in Exeter\u2019s control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cWe have gotten better at racing with each other as a team; there is a new sense of support and competition to PR integrated with our goal of running in groups. It has most definitely pushed me to run harder than I ever have before.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lower Gracy Gray said that although she felt prepared going into the meet, \u201cWhat I love about racing is that something crazy can always happen. All we can do is give it our best effort and see how it plays out.\u201d Although the team had prepared to face the difficulty of Deerfield, the weather was a surprise to both teams. The one who could take advantage of the rain the best would have the power to win, and that\u2019s exactly what Exeter did; take advantage. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Papadakis mentioned a piece of advice that they were given by their captain Sarah Brown before the race. \u201cShe had advised us all to go straight through the puddles so that we don\u2019t slow down,\u201d Papadakis said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Upper Sara Kopunova added another example of how Exeter took advantage of their home course. \u201cThere is a hill near the end which is a prime spot to speed up and pass a few people. I think Exeter handled that well,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Beyond the physical conditions of the course, Papadakis noticed teamwork as an outstanding quality in this race. \u201cWe have gotten better at racing with each other as a team; there is a new sense of support and competition to PR integrated with our goal of running in groups. It has most definitely pushed me to run harder than I ever have before,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In addition to helping the Exeter runners, the weather conditions actually made the race more fun, according to some. Lu commented, \u201cIt was super wet and cold on Saturday, but that actually made the race so much more fun!\u201d Gray echoed, \u201cIt was really great to have another race on our course, and the puddles in the trails made for a fun race.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With only the Exeter\/Andover meet remaining before the big Interscholastic race on November 12, the team sets their sights on taking down the blue, and they encourage people to come out and support them since it will be a home meet. Good luck to the girls as they carry on their undefeated legend.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Rain beat the dirt and swelled in pools on the trails of the Exeter woods as runners hurdled gaping puddles and left their opponents splattered in the mud of their wake.

family and interested booklovers gathered within to listen to Kathryn Aalto\u2014mother of upper Tess and senior August\u2014share some of the magic behind her newest novel this past Saturday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This is Aalto\u2019s second major work, titled \u201cThe Natural World of Winnie-the-Pooh: A Walk Through the Forest that Inspired the Hundred Acre Wood.\u201d The volume explores human intervention in nature using the example of the English countryside that inspired the Winnie-the-Pooh chronicles. She tells the true story of Christopher Robbins, the main character in \u201cWinnie-the-Pooh,\u201d and of how the actual landscape written about in the stories has evolved to the present day. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Aalto grew up in California where she received a B.A. from the University of California, Berkeley, and then moved to Washington in 1992 to receive her master\u2019s degree in creative nonfiction and teach at a local community college. In 2007, she moved to Exeter, England, receiving a second master&#8217;s degree in landscape history from the University of Bristol. There, she raised her two children.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">&#8220;I write this in concern for the changing nature of childhood, and in curiosity of what will happen to the Christopher Robbins&#8217; of the 21st century.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In her talk on Saturday night, she took us through her process of coming up with the idea for the book. Aalto shared stories and pictures about her favorite places to write, which included quaint British pubs and the inspiring countryside of southern England. But when asked what her true inspiration was, Aalto replied, \u201cI wrote this book for my kids. And I wrote to tell the world about the changing environment of childhood.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Since the book\u2019s publication just over a year ago, \u201cThe Natural World of Winnie-the-Pooh\u201d has been a huge hit in the literary world. It has received accolades from major presses like the <i>Washington Post,<\/i> the <i>Wall Street Journal <\/i>and <i>BCC Wildlife Magazine<\/i> as well as ratings on the <i>New York Times<\/i> bestseller list in 2015, a feature on <i>NPR<\/i> and an appearance in <i>People\u2019s Magazine.<\/i><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With the concern for her children and their futures in mind, Aalto expressed a sense of urgency with her message. \u201cI write this in concern for the changing nature of childhood, and in curiosity of what will happen to the Christopher Robbins&#8217; of the 21st century,\u201d she said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">She summarized the style of her book as \u201ca piece of literary and natural history wrapped in a charming narrative.\u201d Aalto uses her background in both creative nonfiction and landscape history to tell a complex story. In her interview, Aalto spoke about the \u201cdual narrative\u201d that exists within her pages. Aalto uses dual narrative as a tool to broaden her readership and include everyone in her story. \u201cI tell a classic and entertaining tail for young readers, and a fascinating geographical history for the adults. It is a visceral experience for people of all ages,\u201d she said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> In her talk, she explained that her book captures the beauty of the exquisite landscapes of nature. During the time she and her family spent in Exeter, England, Aalto was devoted to teaching her family to appreciate nature and to ground their independence in the world outside. Upper Tess Aalto explained that growing up with these ideals has helped her live a \u201cfulfilled\u201d and more \u201csimplistic\u201d life.\u201cGrowing up in the outdoors has made me more adventurous in all aspects of life and really appreciative of what I have,\u201d she said. Kathryn\u2019s son August echoed his sister. \u201cI&#8217;ve melded together a quantitative and poetic appreciation of the natural world.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One of the main themes of Aalto\u2019s novel is to ensure that, through a healthy connection to the natural world, humans maintain a sense of self appreciation, while also gripping onto precious memories of childhood. This message is deeply ingrained into her children. Tess said, \u201cMy Mom\u2019s message is particularly important at the time in life when we\u2019re all growing up. It\u2019s important to be aware and not lose a sense of who you are. I think that nature and place helps center us no matter where we are, and develops an appreciation for our free childhood that we are losing as we grow up.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Aalto looks forward to bringing her story to Exeter in hopes of teaching others in her children\u2019s generation about the beauty of the natural world and the importance of embracing childhood. August said that Exonians should value finding \u201cquiet spots for reflection.\u201d \u201cThat meditative place can go long way to restoring both mind and body after the wear and tear of PEA,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;The Natural World of Winnie-the-Pooh: A Walk Through the Forest that Inspired the Hundred Acre Wood&#8221; is now available at the Exeter Bookstore. Aalto encourages you to go experience all the things the book is designed to induce: nostalgia, enlightenment, appreciation and perspective. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>As rain drizzled softly on the library windows, a crowd of friends, family and interested booklovers gathered within to listen to Kathryn Aalto\u2014mother of upper Tess and senior August\u2014share some of the magic behind her newest novel this past Saturday.

After getting shutout by NMH only four days earlier, Big Red\u2019s offense was thriving once again. Many of the Exeter girls agreed that their success against Tilton came from their team play and that they were truly working together. They needed the momentum and chemistry to take them into their game against Brooks on Saturday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The game against Brooks was special because it was both Family Weekend and the annual breast cancer awareness game. With their bright pink uniforms, the girls took to the field on the gloomy Saturday afternoon. Parents lined up around the perimeter of the field to cheer on the team. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Prep Emma Watson said that \u201ceveryone was a little nervous and a little psyched\u201d because of the big crowds. She also noted, \u201cBeing a little nervous is good, but being too nervous can cost you the game.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Exeter had a tough start to the game, partially due to that nervousness. However, the girls quickly calmed down and got to work. The team had already faced Brooks in the beginning of the season at the field hockey jamboree, so they knew to expect a tough game. Going into the game, Brooks had an impressive 6-4-1 season record and had beaten a handful of teams to which Exeter had lost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cWe have a strong goalie and strong defense, but even a seconds hesitation can cause a goal.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As usual, Exeter played well on defense and stopped many of its opponent\u2019s advances. The Big Red goal keepers were the backbone of the team defensive line and had many saves during this game. Even though the girls continued to steal the ball, block shots and force other turnovers, Brooks\u2019s offense was relentless. Eventually, Brooks began to find its way through the ferocious Exeter defense and added goals to the scoreboard. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Watson explained the importance of timing during the game. \u201cWe have a strong goalie and strong defense, but even a seconds hesitation can cause a goal,\u201d she said. Unfortunately, Exeter found themselves trailing for the remainder of the game and could not close the gap.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Although Exeter was only able to score once during this game, they still had many chances. Their opponents played well together on defense, but Exeter found ways to get shots off multiple times.

Not to Solve a Problem","title_plain":"How Not to Solve a Problem","content":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When I was younger I took ballet classes at a popular dance school in my hometown for many years. The school was located on the second floor of an old warehouse and consisted of two good-sized practice rooms, a small lobby\/office space and a tiny changing room for the female dancers. In this 64-foot square space, we crammed our ballet backpacks and duffels against the walls to keep open valuable floor space. Inevitably, all manner of miscellaneous dancer items spilled from the bags and mingled around the fringe of the room. Although many dancers waited for their classes and parents in the lobby area, the changing room was always packed with girls sitting on the floor playing cards, changing, watching videos and generally hanging out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">All day, every Saturday from September through December, the school rehearsed its annual performance of \u201cThe Nutcracker,\u201d which was open to dancers from other schools and so doubled the number of parents and dancers in the limited space. The floor space in the lobby and even in the hallway was taken up by dozens of dancers eating, stretching and playing cards while waiting to rehearse their parts. The changing room during this time of year became essential in providing space for the extra dancers and their stuff. Though crowded, steamy and messy, it was a really fun place to relax. One year, however, an unforeseen problem presented itself into this semi-organized, pleasant, chaotic little room.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2 pullquote\">Surely you wouldn\u2019t punch someone in the face for having a different opinion. It might serve its purpose, it might make them think or change their opinion, but it will also get you arrested.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">There are many ways to solve any given problem, and there can be many paths to obtain a right answer. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve slaved through math questions and put your multi-stepped problem up on the board, only to have it solved in under three steps by that kid from Vancouver. Both methods do ultimately work, though one may work better than the other. That is why we sit at oval tables and tear each other\u2019s math problems apart for errors, so we can find the best solution to a question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">But what about open-ended problems? Things like English and history, where the answer is hidden under layers and layers of literary technique and primary source analysis? The solutions to those problems may never become clear, or if they do, they may have more than one angle and be ambiguous about their outcomes. You could argue for days about what would have happened had America helped the French peasants overthrow the aristocrats, but the real consequences are still as unclear as they were back in 1805.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The problem popped up when a pair of underwear appeared in the middle of the changing room floor. It had been worn. It had unicorns all over it. But no one would claim it, and so it stayed on the changing room floor for two whole months. Yes, two whole months. People stopped using the dressing room to lounge about. It became an area of business only; people put their bags there and changed but that was it. They waited in the lobby, which, tight as it was, became only tighter with the addition of all the additional bodies. It was impossible to walk from the window at one end of the room to the dance studios at the other without stepping on someone\u2019s fingers. It was quite a pickle. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Surely you wouldn\u2019t punch someone in the face for having a different opinion. It might serve its purpose, it might make them think or change their opinion, but it will also get you arrested. But each solution, even wild ones, have a time and a place. Punching someone in the face because they are stealing your money is an excellent solution. It\u2019s the same solution to the first problem, confronting someone with a different opinion. Even though they are the same solution, they are different problems and thus they require different thinking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">One day as the girls filed into the studio, they discovered that the underwear was gone. Immediately they began to put their bags down, pull out cards and reclaim their hang-out space. But one little girl, keener than the others, pointed to the lost-and-found box in horror. On the very top was the pair of underpants, in all its unicorn and rainbow glory. From that day on, nothing in the lost-and-found box was reclaimable. It overflowed, sweatshirts and water bottles spilling over its sides, but no one would go near it for the presence of the unicorn underoos. If your stuff went in the lost-and-found, it was as good as gone. And the box lost its usefulness as a last-minute source of hair pins, leos and toe tape. As it turned out, the secretary had been the one to sacrifice the lost-and-found box to the undies because, as she said to a crowd of angry bunheads, no one was using the changing room.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">A solution may not be glaringly terrible. It may not cause the deaths of a dozen people, it may not cost you your job, but it can make your life more difficult. If you are facing a problem and you are worried about making a mistake, you shouldn\u2019t fear if you think a little. Solutions should be deliberated and thought about very carefully before they are made. No fix to any conundrum ought to be offered with faulty or incomplete thinking. There is a time and a place for any possible answer, but you have to think for two seconds about whether it\u2019s an appropriate one. Learning how not to solve a problem is just as important as learning how to solve problems in the first place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> I am still very upset about the underwear incident. I lost a really nice water bottle to the lost-and-found box.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>When I was younger I took ballet classes at a popular dance school in my hometown for many years.

He bragged about his failed attempts at seducing a married woman, talking about her \u201cphony t*ts\u201d and how he \u201ctried to f**k her.\u201d He was having a conversation with Billy Bush, who has since been fired from his job on NBC\u2019s \u2018Today\u2019 Show. They said a multitude of vulgar things, including: \u201cwhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the p***y. You can do anything.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">After the release of this video, Donald Trump issued a response, saying that he\u2019s not a \u201cperfect person.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve said and done things I regret, and the words released today on this more than a decade-old video are one of them. Anyone who knows me knows these words don\u2019t reflect who I am,\u201d he said. And later, in a way to explain his actions, he dismissed this conversation as \u201clocker room banter,\u201d and that you hear these sorts of conversations \u201call the time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">First of all, these words reflect exactly who Donald Trump really is. He is a known sexist, to add to the list of being a bigot, racist and all-around jerk. He is known to have called women horrible things such as fat, pigs, slobs, disgusting animals and dogs; he said all these horrible things to women after the event in the video took place. So no, Donald Trump hasn\u2019t changed since the video. And, I\u2019m willing to argue that the only reason he\u2019s apologizing for what he said is because he knows it will lose him a lot of voters, and his apology was a desperate attempt at trying to win them back.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Luckily, this was the last straw for some people, especially among the young voters Trump so desperately lacks and needs. It\u2019s sad that it\u2019s taken some people this long to finally say \u201cenough is enough,\u201d but at least they\u2019ve come out of their dark shell of denial. A recent poll at Quinnipiac University taken almost immediately after the video was leaked on the Washington Post, found Trump trailing among likely voters aged 18 to 34, 48 percent to 27 percent. In another instance that took place also on a college campus, Liberty University President Falwell, to defend Trump regarding the \u201clocker room banter\u201d video, said, \u201cWe\u2019re all sinners,\u201d as though sexual assault is no big deal, a problem we don\u2019t need to prioritize in eradicating. The students on his campus had a very different reaction. \u201cAny faculty or staff member at Liberty would be terminated for such comments, and yet when Donald Trump makes them, President Falwell rushes eagerly to his defense\u2014taking the name \u2018Liberty University\u2019 with him,\u201d a group of Liberty students said in a statement condemning Trump\u2019s association with their school. The collision between the recent explosion of awareness for sexual assault on college campuses and the presidential election makes for a very bad mixture for Trump.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">The students weren\u2019t the only ones condemning Trump. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who has defended Trump on through many of his controversies, said, \u201cNo woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever.\u201d And House Speaker Paul Ryan, who has been campaigning for and with Trump, said the comments in the video \u201csickened\u201d him, and also added: \u201cWomen are to be championed and revered, not objectified. I hope Mr. Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than this clip suggests.\u201d That\u2019s funny, because I really think he doesn\u2019t have much respect for us women at all.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">This isn\u2019t just \u201clocker room banter.\u201d The fact that he\u2019s condoning this, saying that it\u2019s normal to have these type of vulgar and horrible conversations about women in a \u201clocker room\u201d setting is disgusting. No one, no where, at any time should be having conversations like that. This incident is just a repeating and terrifyingly familiar pattern of denial that perpetuates the rape culture that our society subconsciously accepts as a part of our lives. But we can, and we have to, change this mindset.

However, several points need to be clarified regarding what\u2019s actually going on behind the admission crisis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> It is true that the region-by-region test administration in China\u2019s college admission exam, <i>Gaokao<\/i>, has resulted in unfair circumstances; the students from the major cities in China usually receive an easier version of test than those in the rural areas. For example, the <i>Gaokao <\/i>test in Shanghai is normally easier than that of its neighboring provinces, Jiangsu and Zhejiang; a student in Beijing can go to a much better college than a student in Shandong province who achieved the same score. However, the main factor that leads to the problem is not bureaucracy or corruption. It is China\u2019s distinct feature of regional differences, which makes it very hard to unify the country with the same standard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3 pullquote\"><span class=\"s1\">It is China\u2019s distinct feature of regional differences, which makes it very hard to unify the country with the same standard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><br \/>\nThe majority of China\u2019s top universities are located in the economically developed cities, offering students in big cities more chances to receive a better education. In addition, it is becoming a new trend that families in big cities prefer to send their children to study abroad. The soaring number of students abroad considerably reduces the number of students taking the Gaokao test, forcing the administration to further lower the admission criterion in big cities.Unlike America, China has an extremely uneven physical distribution of its population. One example is that, in 1987, a Chinese demographer proposed that if we were to draw a line from a northeastern city (Heihe), to a southwestern city (Tengchong), we would discover that 94.4 percent of China\u2019s population lives on the eastern side of the line, while only 5.6 percent of the population inhabits the western side, which in fact takes up 57.1 percent of the total territory. The imbalanced allocation of population, resulting from the differences in climate and geographic features, contributes to the uneven economic development and disproportionate distribution of educational resource among regions. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">In recent years, universities in China are paying more attention to students\u2019 overall development apart from their test scores. An increasing number of prestigious universities in China are now carrying out a policy called \u201cIndependent Recruitment.\u201d The overall excellent students are nominated by their high schools to attend an interview with the professors from the universities, the topic of which covers the analysis hotspot issues, literary classics, frontier technologies, etc. The admission officers now evaluate not only a student\u2019s performance in school but also his (or her) performance during the interview, including the ability to quickly respond and think innovatively. If a student passes the interview, he (or she) still needs to take <i>Gaokao<\/i> to test academic proficiency, but the required admission score is greatly reduced. Chinese universities are now considering a student more as an individual \u201cperson\u201d instead of a \u201ctest machine,\u201d which will gradually change the test-driven atmosphere in Chinese high schools. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">In recent years, China\u2019s Department of Education has experimented <i>Gaokao<\/i> reform in several cities, aiming to reduce students\u2019 pressure upon taking the test. Students now need to take three elective subject tests and three major subject tests. Instead of sitting for all the subject tests in three days, students are now able to start taking the majority of the elective subject tests from the second year of high school, and two chances are available each year for the English test. In order to encourage students to participate in community service, 60 hours of voluntary work is now required for high school graduation. Many high schools in China are recognizing the importance of physical well being and putting more emphasis on improving the quality of physical education by renovating facilities, increasing the number of P.E. lessons and developing school teams. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">While the inequality that lies in the distribution of educational resources in China still remains an alarming issue, it is worth noting that China\u2019s college admission system is undergoing drastic reform for the sake of its students. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>The article \u201cChina\u2019s College Admission Crisis\u201d published in last week\u2019s Opinion section of The Exonian provided a good analysis of China\u2019s college enrollment system.

But conservatism has definitely evolved and in this election, it has shown its true, ugly colors as a promoter of bigotry and fear. Conservatism in America is changing, but that\u2019s a piece for another time. For now, it is important to understand why Donald Trump is a blessing in disguise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Republicans want to repeal Obamacare. They want to defund Planned Parenthood. They want to loosen our already-lax gun laws. Regardless of who the candidate is, that is still the end goal of most Republicans. I completely disagree with them on all these subjects, and thus, would find it tragic to see a Republican president. However, to the benefit of me and millions of other Democrats, Trump has basically ensured a democratic victory. Every time he makes a racist comment, maybe 50 republicans of color change their minds about him. Every time he makes a sexist comment, maybe 50 Republican women change their minds. The point is that the more Donald talks, the less likely people want to vote for him. He and he alone has brought down the Republican party, and we should thank him for this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Donald\u2019s rude. He\u2019s arrogant. He\u2019s insecure. He doesn\u2019t know when to apologize, and he doesn\u2019t know when to back down from a fight. He prefers to write bitter tweets at 3 a.m. than to have a face-to-face debate. When faced with a problem of his own creation, he never admits that he\u2019s at fault. Many of his conservative supporters who were unenthused by him are now completely terrified of what his presidency would be like (might I add with good reason). His being the Republican nominee is an incredible victory for the Democratic party; as support of Donald becomes less and less fashionable, many have no choice but to turn to Clinton (or not to vote at all, another huge problem this country will experience this election). Let\u2019s face it; most conservatives don\u2019t like Trump. The Democratic party\u2019s main goal should be to try and convince these middle-of-the-road conservatives to vote for Hillary. It is of paramount importance that these votes are cast; they can, without a doubt, change the course of the election for the better.

These arguments resurfaced with the FBI\u2019s request for software capable of decrypting data on Apple\u2019s iPhones in the wake of the 2015 San Bernardino shootings. One of the suspects, Syed Farook, owned an iPhone that the FBI believed could provide information to illuminate who else was behind the shootings. After numerous failed attempts to hack into the phone, mostly unsuccessful due to Apple products\u2019 inbuilt precautions against such hacks, the FBI directly requested downloadable software from Apple that could install a \u201cbackdoor\u201d into the iPhone. In such compromising situations, we may have to forsake our privacy to preserve the security of all at the expense of a skeleton proposal for an idea that could provide major roadblocks instead of advantages. The argument then boils down to what we value more: personal privacy or the communal safety of others? Is creating a backdoor really worth it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">The murkiness of the legal background of the FBI-Apple case and use of such outdated rules shows how unprecedented and immoral the idea of a \u201cbackdoor\u201d really is.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">From a legal standpoint, it\u2019s evident that the Fed\u2019s access to our private information is an affront to the Fourth Amendment, which outlaws unreasonable searches and seizures. Even with a valid warrant, the FBI\u2019s demand that Apple break the encryption on personal data is far from moral or even constitutional. The request for Apple\u2019s signature on the code for decrypting personal data on iPhones is compelled speech, rather than free speech. Nevertheless, the FBI has gone to great lengths to circumvent these rules by citing a 200-year-old act, the All Writs Act, that mandates a party to assist in a relevant federal investigation unless the request entails an \u201cundue burden.\u201d However, it can be easily argued that Apple is a private company and does not share a direct connection to their devices after issuing, thereby definitely making the request for a backdoor an undue burden. The murkiness of the legal background of the FBI-Apple case and use of such outdated rules shows how unprecedented and immoral the idea of a \u201cbackdoor\u201d really is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Even if the cause for a \u201cbackdoor\u201d into the iPhone can be considered noble, we can also call into question the actual efficacy of the approach. Can a backdoor actually help us detain criminals in a fashion that trumps our current methods? The end can\u2019t justify the means if the achievement of the desired end cannot be guaranteed. In fact, creating software for decrypting iPhones or removing the feature of wiping all encrypted data after ten unsuccessful password attempts will just make it catastrophically easier for brute force password attacks to become successful. Such a trend for all devices could even result in an eventual facilitation of cyber espionage, and the practice of creating \u201cbackdoors\u201d could exacerbate trends of censorship in other nations by providing those presiding oppressive regimes with an ultimate weapon that leaves the private data of all citizens vulnerable. It would be an excessive length to expose misconduct in a minority of criminals while prying into the private lives of a majority of innocent, honest people. As Apple\u2019s CEO Tim Cook notes, the crimes alluded to in monitored private data is like hate speech; it may be despicable and warrant counter-action, but it\u2019s protected by free speech.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The \u201cbackdoor\u201d idea itself is ridiculous when we realize that there are other ways of getting into a specific iPhone. The FBI itself soon learned of a way, with the help of an unnamed third party, to acquire the data from the phone without Apple\u2019s assistance. A universal installation of a \u201cbackdoor\u201d was just too risky when the immediate repercussions and future implications of such a practice are considered. We can\u2019t perpetuate a practice that poses the very endangerment of our security it\u2019s supposed to protect.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Starting from Edward Snowden\u2019s disclosure of NSA\u2019s global surveillance in 2013, we more frequently see ourselves ending up in heated debates pertaining to the use of personal data for the facilitation of justice.

Repeat until your coach gets the idea. Also, don\u2019t stress about going to assembly. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s a required appointment or anything.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">-Grace<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<p class=\"p1\">Dear Grace,<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">I have a history paper that\u2019s due at finals block, and we only just got the prompt!

Here\u2019s my trick for getting my papers assigned far in advance done on time: Set aside some time every day to forget about the history paper and procrastinate. My preferred procrastination method? Snapchat. Try out every filter. Then, the night before the paper is due, remember it, then spend your entire evening thinking about ways to BS your way through it. This method WILL get you an A.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">-Grace<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<p class=\"p1\">Dear Grace,<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">My early app is due on November 1st!
