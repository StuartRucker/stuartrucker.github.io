He served as the director of alumni affairs for most of his tenure and the director of alumni and parent relations for three years. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At the Salisbury School, Brown will be the director of development and responsible for supervision and oversight of all fundraising activities. \u201cFor many years it has been my desire to direct a fundraising operation,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When Brown graduated from Exeter in 1974, he did not have plans to work for the school. In his first 10 years as an alumnus, the only Exeter-related event he attended was his fifth reunion. In 1988, Wick Sloane \u201971 contacted Brown and requested he help organize a welcome dinner for Kendra O\u2019Donnell, Exeter\u2019s 12th principal, in Hartford, Conn. Shortly after, classmate David Henderson asked Brown to lead a fundraising project to paint a portrait of English instructor and admissions officer William Bolden, one of the first faculty members of color at the Academy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cMy time at Exeter, man and boy, has been an immeasurably transformative and rewarding experience\u2014all of it because of extraordinary people.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Brown became more involved with projects at and around Exeter, and eventually became an official staff member of the Academy. Recruited by classmate Linda Lanton, Brown participated in a program initiated by O\u2019Donnell to promote cultural diversity at Exeter. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This work led to an appointment on the Board of Directors of the General Alumni Association, and in 1991, Director of Development Jim Theisen recruited and O\u2019Donnell appointed Brown as the Director of Alumni Affairs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Brown\u2019s colleagues in the Office of Institutional Advancement described Brown as a kind and passionate leader and friend whom they will all miss seeing at work. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Christine Fell, the assistant to the Executive Director of Alumni Relations and International Gifts, worked alongside Brown for twenty years. She said that Brown always motivated others to embrace their potential because it made him happy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">She will miss hearing him encourage the Alumni Relations staff and say, \u201cThat lights me up.\u201d He created a friendly and humorous environment in Nathaniel Gilman House. Alumni Relations Program Manager Dawn Perkins said that in addition to the positive energy, thankfulness and goodness he provided, she will also miss his invaluable and knowledge of Academy history, names and events. Answering questions from <i>The Exonian<\/i> by email, Brown said he was thankful for the atmosphere in the office that his colleagues and close friends provided.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Assistant Director of Student and Young Alumni Programs Michelle Curtin worked for Brown for eight years, and she found his \u201cenergy, enthusiasm for work and his ability to always see the picture\u201d remarkable and qualities she will surely miss. \u201cHe has a huge heart and truly cares for the people he works with on both a professional and personal level,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Assistant Director of Alumni Relations Benita O\u2019Connell agreed with Curtin, saying that Brown\u2019s dedication to keeping the relationships of the alumni as his top priority exemplified an Alumni Relations professional. \u201cHe has been a joy to work with,\u201d she said. O\u2019Connell explained that while she will miss working with him in their office, everyone is very excited for him to have a new opportunity to share his talents with a different school and alumni network.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Curtin and O\u2019Connell were thankful that Brown, as an alum of Exeter, will remain a fundamental part of the school and cross paths in the future at events both on and off campus. \u201cAs an alumnus of PEA, he will continue to be involved and we look forward to having his support as a volunteer, again,\u201d O\u2019Connell said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Although Brown\u2019s role at the Academy was primarily involved with alumni communication, the students in Merrill Hall knew him as a supportive dorm affiliate since last year. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Yoshiko Lynch said that although she only knew him for one year, she felt that he was a brother because of his genuine kindness and care. \u201cI love having conversations with him because you can tell that he\u2019s really interested in what you have to say,\u201d she said. Lynch recalled a moment at the senior and alumni dinner when she felt awkward and alone, and once she saw Brown, she felt instant relief. \u201cHe came right up to me, hugged me and introduced me to these two [alumni] that I had a great conversation with,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When Brown was on duty on Tuesday nights, the students enjoyed listening to his stories and advice in the common room. Upper Jayleen Jaime explained that Brown became an integral part of Merrill and his storytelling on duty became a tradition.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>When dates arrived before Evening Prayer, Jaime explained that Brown would \u201ctake the role of the dad of Merrill\u201d and give their dates a hard time. He also provided Jaime with wise advice on getting through Exeter as a student of color.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Brown will miss all of the people he has become close to during his time at Exeter. \u201cMy time at Exeter, man and boy, has been an immeasurably transformative and rewarding experience\u2014all of it because of extraordinary people,\u201d he said. He acknowledged the impact of many of his former teachers and additional faculty whose \u201cwork and character have been mentors and role models\u201d for him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He said that he will miss witnessing and experiencing the \u201cimmense generosity that exists within the Exeter community\u201d after being involved with alumni relations at Exeter for 25 years. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He will also miss seeing the multitude of alumni and parents worldwide who have become closer through Exeter. \u201cIn all of this and even more, my Exeter experience has been a rich blessing for which I am and will forever be thankful,\u201d Brown said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Looking forward, Brown expressed excitement towards contributing to a different school in a new environment, with a similar mission. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe Salisbury School is an excellent school and aligns well with my values about secondary school education.\u201d he said. \u201cI am honored to have the opportunity to help advance its mission.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>After 25 years of dedicated work at the Academy, Executive Director of Alumni Relations and International Gifts Harold Brown will begin working at the Salisbury School.

The day celebrates coming out as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, asexual, demi sexual or queer (LGBTQ+).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">GSA encouraged students to participate in the NOH8 campaign. NOH8 is a charitable organization that seeks to promote equality for LGBTQ+ individuals by photographing participants with \u201cNOH8\u201d written on the cheeks and silver duct tape across the mouth. GSA also asked the student body to show their support by wearing purple. Though wearing purple is associated with the celebration of Spirit Day, a day dedicated to combating the bullying directed towards members of the LGBTQ+ community, GSA coheads felt that wearing purple on Coming Out Day would make it even more impactful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">GSA also erected a door on the Academic Quad to represent those who have come out in the past and to welcome those who choose to come out in the future. In an email to club members, GSA coheads encouraged people to \u201cwalk through it and come out as whatever you want.\u201d The door also had a sign advertising GSA\u2019s Tuesday night meeting, where members and non-members alike could drop by to be photographed for the NOH8 Campaign.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Joanne Lembo, Director of Student Activities and adviser to GSA, hoped that these initiatives would help students understand that they have a \u201csafe place\u201d on campus. In the six years that GSA has put up the door on Coming Out Day, Lembo has seen interest steadily rise. Though she acknowledged that not everyone will feel comfortable enough to walk through it, she believed that it served a more \u201csymbolic\u201d purpose. In her opinion, the door represents the Academy\u2019s<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>recognition that not all will choose to go through it, but that it is there and it welcomes all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cNational Coming Out day is when I can look back and see how far I\u2019ve come in realizing my identity and accepting myself for who I am, unapologetically.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lower Miranda Derossi said she loved the door. \u201cI think it makes a statement and raises awareness for how important this day really is,\u201d she said. Lower Makinrola Orafidiya agreed and added that the door \u201cis really good for people who want to go through it and have it mean something to them.\u201d Comparing it to \u201creal-life clickbait,\u201d lower Emeline Scales commented on the magnetic quality of the door in drawing passersby to it. \u201cPeople will approach it, and although there will be people who make fun of it, it really does get the message out there to people who had no idea,\u201d Scales said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Grace Duisberg also liked the door, but, like Scales, saw that it could create opportunity for judgement from members of the community. \u201cI feel like people can be kind of judgmental and that makes people hesitant to use it,\u201d she observed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Responding to this concern, Dean of Multicultural Affairs Rosanna Salcedo pointed out that, for many people, fear of being judged prevents them from coming out as who they truly are. \u201cWe should be aware that there are people around us everyday who keep a part of who they are a secret, not because they want to, but because they fear prejudice, discrimination and even persecution,\u201d she said. Salcedo continued, describing this as \u201ca terrible burden to carry, a burden society inflicts on LGBTQ+ individuals unnecessarily.\u201d Salcedo also drew attention to the fears experienced by allies, noting that some people are afraid to be open about their support of LGBTQ+ individuals because of potential judgement from others. \u201cIf coming out as a supporter is difficult, imagine how hard it is for LGBTQ+ individuals to come out,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While Coming Out Day does not make coming out any less difficult, it offers a chance to celebrate the courage of those who have come out and welcomes those who are not yet ready to do so. Derossi saw it as \u201ca time to accept and love yourself, and to celebrate your sexual orientation, romantic orientation and gender identity, as well as a time for others to show their support.\u201d As Orafidiya pointed out, Coming Out Day can help people in the closet realize their identities or see that they are not alone. This rang true for Scales, who explained, \u201cNational Coming Out day is when I can look back and see how far I\u2019ve come in realizing my identity and accepting myself for who I am, unapologetically.\u201d Scales found it comforting to remind herself of how much she has grown over the past few years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For Salcedo, the day is an opportunity to reflect on LGBTQ+<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>individuals she knows and loves, and their coming out stories. \u201cWhile the journey was different for each of them, taking the step to live their life openly required tremendous courage,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom them I have learned the lesson of being true to oneself, and I am grateful for that.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">According to lower Adrian Venzon, a cohead of GSA, Coming Out Day removes some of the pressure that comes along with coming out \u201cbecause it\u2019s easy to see that you\u2019re not the only one.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, Venzon thought that Exeter could do a better job of celebrating it. Though a school-wide email was sent out detailing the events of the day and its importance, he felt that \u201cpeople didn\u2019t really take it to heart.\u201d Likewise, Duisberg questioned its effectiveness given that \u201ca fair number of people don\u2019t read the mass emails.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Duisburg also pointed out that wearing purple, though a good way to raise awareness, is only effective if \u201cwe all know what it means.\u201d Furthermore, Venzon expressed surprise at how few people actually wore purple on Tuesday. Derossi, too, noticed that not many students wore purple and those who did mostly belonged to GSA. \u201cI think it would be nice to have more campus-wide recognition of National Coming Out Day as a real and important celebration,\u201d she concluded.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Scales, however, felt that wearing purple and the NOH8 campaign were \u201ca wonderful way for allies or closeted LGBT members who don\u2019t feel comfortable coming to GSA to show support for LGBT.\u201d Since GSA began participating in the NOH8 campaign four years ago, Lembo has seen it gain popularity. \u201cPeople post on social media and it\u2019s an easy fun way of getting together,\u201d she said. For Derossi, \u201cthe NOH8 pictures are always fun and they have a powerful message,\u201d while Duisberg added that they are \u201ca fun way to bond in the community.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Exeter\u2019s Gender and Sexuality Alliance (GSA) worked to raise awareness of the LGBTQ+ community on National Coming\u00a0 Out Day, last Tuesday, Oct. 11.

little. And it\u2019s not physical sensation, but rather an enveloping visceral experience that is distinctly embedded in the nature of film. It is when a film leaps beyond the boundaries of logic, and pursues our primal senses and feelings through image and sound. Only the greatest, such as Stanley Kubrick and Andrei Tarkovsky, have achieved such daunting depths in filmmaking. It is this approach to filmmaking that drives the brilliance behind director\/animator Don Hertzfeldt\u2019s magnum opus \u201cIt\u2019s Such a Beautiful Day.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Watching \u201cIt\u2019s Such a Beautiful Day\u201d is an extremely bizarre and occasionally amusing experience. Stylistically, the film follows in the footsteps of Hertzfeldt\u2019s earlier short films, which contain an odd concoction of surrealism, idiosyncratic humor and minimalistic animation. However, on a narrative and thematic level, \u201cIt\u2019s Such a Beautiful Day\u201d distinguishes itself from those short films by reaching for something more profound. The film\u2019s core narrative is about a stick figure named Bill and the decline of his mental health. The film functions as an exploration of feelings and memories, and unfolds less as a cohesive story and more as a series of vignettes unified by Bill\u2019s struggles in life and impending death. Each scene ranges from the mundane to the absolute insane, both accomplished with equal believability. Even with such heavy subject matter, Hertzfeldt still maintains an absurd sense of humor, often communicated through his hilariously amateurish and monotonous narration.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt\u2019s Such a Beautiful Day\u201d is clearly the product of an auteur. The film\u2019s animation, sound design, special effects, narration and screenwriting were all completed by Hertzfeldt slaving away at his home. Despite this, the film still displays a remarkable level of inventiveness and technical sophistication. His animation style is distinctly characterized by stick figures and simple two-dimensional line drawings. If put in the hands of a lesser director\/animator, the film could have come off as childish and lazy, but Hertzfeldt manages to bring a renewed power to the style. After receiving the news of his terminal disease, there\u2019s a moment where Bill slowly takes off his hat and rubs his head. It\u2019s such a delicate moment that exemplifies the power of Hertzfeldt\u2019s simplicity. In order to display such an intimate level of rawness, the film must strip its visuals down to the bare bones of what makes us human.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Beyond the film\u2019s sequences of pen-and-paper animation, Hertzfeldt applies a wide palette of techniques. During Bill\u2019s hallucinations and daydreams, the film intersperses shots of distorted live-action with Douglas Trumbull-style special effects, reminiscent of Kubrick\u2019s \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d or Terrence Malick\u2019s \u201cThe Tree of Life.\u201d What really caught my attention was the film\u2019s use of sound. As in his previous films, Hertzfeldt loves to decorate blank frames with extremely lush and atmospheric sound. Sound effects, music and dialogue complement each other, and are sped up, slowed down, looped, panned from channel to channel and played backwards to create a cacophony of soundscapes. It is akin to the surreal and disturbing sound design of David Lynch\u2019s \u201cEraserhead.\u201d Hertzfeldt executes all of these techniques with such deliberation that it creates the perfect atmosphere for us to enter and experience the collapse of Bill\u2019s mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Ultimately, \u201cIt\u2019s Such a Beautiful Day\u201d is not just about Bill. It\u2019s about how there\u2019s a headstone waiting for all of us. Bill\u2019s failing mind is no different from our illogical and broken world, and his musings of daily life remind us that we are all struggling. The film\u2019s humor and raw animation style prevent these ideas from becoming pretentious and heavy-handed. Maybe that is why Bill\u2019s outlandish journeys evoke such strong emotion, because they describe on a deeply visceral and philosophical note what it means to be human. For what it\u2019s worth, we should appreciate our existence, even for all its craziness.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Very rarely is a director capable of creating so much sensation on screen with so little.

Since the articles\u2019 publication, some members of the PEA community have expressed concern and frustration at a bias they see in <i>The Globe\u2019s<\/i> writing. Despite criticism of the press coverage, the administration and members of the community have taken steps in the past three months to raise awareness about consent and sexual assault on campus. The school has made numerous administrative changes and hired outside investigators. Some alumni have threatened to withhold financial support. Two student organizations, Exonians Against Sexual Assault and <i>MVMENT Magazine<\/i>, were established to address sexual misconduct on campus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Scott Allen, Spotlight team editor at <i>The Boston Globe<\/i>, explained that his team began to cover sexual misconduct at private schools last year after one of their reporters, Bella English, exposed years of previously unreported sexual abuse at St. George\u2019s School in Rhode Island. They began to look at reports of sexual misconduct at private and parochial schools across New England, and found that their investigations yielded surprisingly fruitful results. \u201cFrankly, we found a lot more allegations than we expected,\u201d Allen said. \u201cIncluding many that had never been made public and involved current teachers.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cWe do everything in our power to contact people who represent all perspectives in controversial incidents such as sexual misconduct allegations.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">English instructor Becky Moore said that what she has observed at Exeter regarding its handling of sexual misconduct cases does not fully align with what the <i>Globe<\/i> has reported. \u201cIn the case of the recent <i>Globe<\/i> articles about PEA, I know enough about the integrity of the colleagues mentioned to know that there must be more information that has not been made available to the media for reasons of student privacy or school litigation,\u201d she said. \u201cI am close enough to the institutional community to know of the complexities that I do not think have been fully represented in the stories.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In addition, Health instructor Michelle Soucy feared that<i> The Globe<\/i> had not taken necessary precautions to prevent negative consequences as a result of the publication of the articles. \u201c[<i>The Globe<\/i>] was a little too specific with some of the cases, which made it easy for members of our community to figure out who the people were,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that was a mistake.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In spite of these accusations, Allen reported that the Spotlight team of reporters at <i>The Globe<\/i> have worked hard throughout their coverage of these sexual misconduct cases to ensure that they are hearing from a broad variety of people. \u201cWe talked to scores and scores of people to produce our stories on sexual misconduct, including alleged victims, witnesses, lawyers, teachers, school officials and others,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWe do everything in our power to contact people who represent all perspectives in controversial incidents such as sexual misconduct allegations.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In addition, reporters sought documentation in as many cases as possible, looking for evidence ranging from lawsuits to police reports to school disciplinary proceedings. \u201cWe look for corroborating evidence of every claim,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWe also seek out contemporaneous documentation such as police reports or email that are sometimes more authoritative than people\u2019s memories after the fact.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Allen described the investigative process <i>The Globe<\/i> took for the July 2016 article they published, which revealed Exeter\u2019s alleged mishandling of a recent sexual misconduct case at Exeter involving two students from the class of 2016.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>As well as interviewing the complainant, <i>The Globe<\/i> acquired emails from Reverend Robert H. Thompson, in which he said that the respondent expressed his regret and took responsibility for what he had done. They also acquired emails from Dean Melissa Mischke, which provided the school\u2019s view on what happened after a school investigator interviewed him. \u201cOur story about [the respondent] did not rely solely on [the complainant\u2019s] perspective,\u201d Allen said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Mischke declined to comment. Members of the administration are unable to comment at this time due to ongoing legal investigations into cases of sexual misconduct involving the Academy.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>\u201cThe specific situation you are inquiring about is in the hands of law enforcement, and therefore the school administration will not be sharing any additional information,\u201d Principal MacFarlane said, in a Sept. 8 interview with <i>The Exonian<\/i>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Although the administration cannot comment on the cases covered by <i>The Globe<\/i> articles at this time, they have taken steps to address the issues raised. The academy has made revisions to the E-Book, hired two interim directors of student wellbeing, Tina Sciocchetti and Jane Stapleton, had faculty receive boundary training, updated the faculty handbook and code of conduct, published a Sexual Misconduct Prevention and Response Action Plan, and has hired lawyers and consultants to review current policies and past cases of misconduct. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Nevertheless, Allen acknowledged that his team of reporters were not always able to incorporate the voices of every person involved, sometimes for reasons out of his control. \u201cWe also reached out to [the other student], members of his family and his attorney to give them an opportunity to comment,\u201d he said. \u201cThey declined.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He went on, explaining that the Spotlight team approached the story with particular care because of the youth of the involved parties. \u201cWe worked to make sure [the students\u2019 attorneys] understood fully the nature of our story,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end, we felt it was an important story to tell since it provided an inside look at how one of the nation\u2019s leading private schools handled a recent sexual misconduct complaint.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Bonnie LaBont\u00e9 thought <i>The Globe<\/i> should have taken more steps to ensure that all parties were accurately represented. \u201cPerhaps <i>The Boston Globe<\/i> could have had facts confirmed and also examined both sides of the story to give a clearer understanding of what happened,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Tayo Zenger felt that bias was inherent in articles on complex issues like sexual misconduct. \u201cDon\u2019t believe everything you read,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it comes to articles regarding sexual misconduct, in my opinion, we will never know the complete story.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">History instructor Michael Golay said the school itself may have had reasons for not talking directly to <i>The Globe<\/i>, but he understood why it would then make sense for the newspaper to move forward with the piece. \u201cThe school maintains its valid reasons about why it can\u2019t be candid about these cases,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a newspaper waited for powerful institutions to talk to them when it was convenient for the institutions, nothing would ever get reported.\u201d LaBont\u00e9 questioned the papers\u2019 motives in the long-term coverage of this issue at private schools, and why few articles have been published about public school cases. \u201cI think <i>The Boston Globe<\/i> loves to see rich people behaving poorly,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd sometimes they exploit the stories for their own benefit.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Allen explained that, though sexual misconduct at public schools is undoubtedly an issue, the Spotlight team has been focused on addressing the symptoms of sexual abuse particular to private schools because of their environments. \u201cWe have tried to be clear throughout that there is no evidence that sexual misconduct is more prevalent at private schools than public ones,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, child advocates have said that the boarding school setting creates unique opportunities for abuse.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For Allen and the rest of the Spotlight team, their recent coverage of boarding school sexual misconduct has given them the opportunity to write about what they believe is an important and relevant issue. \u201cToday\u2019s students are our future and the public is right to be concerned about their safety and wellbeing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe talked to many past victims of sexual abuse in school who were still traumatized many decades after their teachers took advantage of their trust and their innocence.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Golay said the work <i>The Globe<\/i> had done was solid and as thorough as it could have been, given the circumstances of confidentiality. \u201c<i>The Globe<\/i> has done service to us and to other schools by focusing on this issue and doing what I consider to be pretty sophisticated, very substantial reporting on an issue that should interest all of us,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Allen emphasized the importance of bringing the topic matter covered in <i>The Globe<\/i> series to light. \u201cIt\u2019s a clich\u00e9, but it\u2019s true: today\u2019s students are our future and the public is right to be concerned about their safety and wellbeing,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">LaBont\u00e9 agreed with Allen, despite her misgivings about the biased nature of <i>The Globe\u2019s<\/i> reporting. \u201cThe stories seem one sided and exaggerated, but they bring attention to problems of our past and start discussion,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Upper Chiara Perotti Correa said that she, too, found the reporting to be an important piece that helped to instigate change on campus. Correa highlighted the detriments as well as the benefits of <i>The Globe\u2019s<\/i> reporting. \u201cIt has brought up awareness,\u201d she said. \u201cBut at the same time, it has damaged the lives of people involved.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Allen said he hoped <i>The Globe\u2019s<\/i> reporting has opened up discussion and change across the country.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe are extremely grateful that our stories have forced a national conversation about sexual misconduct in private schools, a conversation that was long overdue,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Over the course of the past year, The Boston Globe\u2019s spotlight team has published a series of articles on cases of sexual misconduct at Exeter, a part of a larger series covering this issue at boarding and private day schools across New England.

on campus at Tuesday\u2019s assembly, narrating personal stories in an attempt to illuminate possible areas of improvement for Exeter. Senior Livaslou Tanjong began planning the assembly last year because she felt like conversations about race had dwindled. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Tanjong solicited short essays from six students of color to discuss their experiences and difficulties they regularly face as minorities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Upper Christian Flores delivered the first speech of the assembly, focusing on his family and his upbringing. He contrasted his father, a bus driver, and his mother, a public school teacher assistant, to businessmen and professors, professions he considered typical of many Exeter parents. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He explained what it is like for him to have parents who are not fluent in English, and how his family is often stared at while speaking Spanish in public. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Initially, he didn\u2019t want to speak because he thought he was expected to represent the Latinx community as a whole. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cBut then I was told to talk about myself, I felt more enthusiastic because I felt as though I wasn\u2019t bound to anyone or any community and could talk about my own personal experience,\u201d Flores said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Nada Zohayr spoke about both her and her mothers\u2019 experiences as women of color. She expressed concerns about POC allies using the issue of race as a platform to push their own agendas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cIt\u2019s like being invited to the dinner table party but you\u2019re not making me a place at the table, so I have to make my own place at that table.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">She drew parallels between her mother\u2019s experience and her own, describing Exeter as a place that was not built for the success of people of color, but rather \u201cProtestant white boys.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">She expressed what it\u2019s like for her to attend Exeter with an analogy. \u201cIt\u2019s like being invited to the dinner table party but you\u2019re not making me a place at the table, so I have to make my own place at that table.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">After Zohayr, lower Adrian Venzon spoke about his experience as a gay Asian American on campus. While hesitant about speaking about the \u201ctouchy subject\u201d of race at first, he eventually decided to accept Tanjong\u2019s offer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As a co-head of Gender and Sexuality Alliance (GSA) and a member of the Asian Advisory Board, he felt it was his duty to speak about his identity. He said he hoped the assembly will open up opportunities to talk about race, which he doesn\u2019t normally discuss regularly with his friends.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In his speech, Venzon touched upon some of the issues Asian Americans face. Although he admitted that before coming to Exeter he was not aware of these issues and never saw himself as being part of a minority, he recalled an Exonian Encounter meeting when he first realized that most Asians are portrayed poorly, or not at all, in movies and television. He also has come face to face with the model minority myth while on campus. \u201cI still hear things like \u2018Asians are so good at math,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cOne, I\u2019m not that good at math, and two, if I was, it wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with me being Asian.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Leena Hamad spoke about her experience identifying as Sudanese, African, Muslim, Arab and American. She told stories about her identities being trivialized and misunderstood. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Hamad said she is constantly misidentified and questioned about where she is from, and felt concerned that conversations around race seem to have dissipated. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt\u2019s something that needs to be talked about, and when we do talk about it usually it\u2019s very politicized, but we don\u2019t really get into the personal aspects of race,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Kelvin Green II told stories about his growth as a POC at Exeter, such as his experience listening to other students of color speak on Friday nights at Afro-Latino Exonian Society (ALES). He then spoke about the importance of supporting the \u201cyouth from every quarter\u201d that makes up the student body, not only by adding another black faculty member. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He also expressed how lucky he is to be at a school where he can speak freely about racial issues to a community that cares.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Tanjong, the final speaker, hoped that hers and others\u2019 words will encourage students to speak up, voice their questions and support their peers. She also urges people to attend events and club meetings to show their support for POC as well as to educate themselves on one of today\u2019s most common, yet most misunderstood issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Tanjong ended the assembly with insight into her life as a member of a minority group saying, \u201cbeing black at Exeter means speaking in a conversation to which you are the only participant. It means that in spite of offering my voice, I am often met by your silences. Race is the awkward topic that no one wants to broach.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Dean of Multicultural Affairs Rosanna Salcedo felt that it is important for students of color to have the opportunity to vocalize their concerns, which otherwise can be overlooked and go unheard. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">She believed that it is difficult to have discussions regarding issues of diversity and equity because they are often seen as \u201csecondary to academic subjects, lacking in intellectual value and otherwise unimportant.\u201d She said this disadvantages everyone because it prevents progression in the community.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe most important thing we can do to support students and faculty of color is improve our social consciousness,\u201d Salcedo said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cGreater consciousness about these issues would hopefully inspire a sense of individual and collective responsibility to address inequities when we witness them.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Mathematics instructor and ALES adviser Sami Atif felt that the assembly was effective because it gave \u201cvoices to the voiceless\u201d and put a \u201cspotlight\u201d on bystanders. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In light of the campaign season, he hopes that the class of 2017 does not graduate \u201cless equipped\u201d than preceding classes to discuss race and its intricate implications in every community. \u201cMiseducation about differences is a threat to the nation,\u201d he said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Atif also felt that although the \u201ctraditionally, exclusively white male\u201d faculty has made progress, especially with the extensive electives offered, the curriculum is still a challenge for POC on campus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cA difficulty I hear too often from students of color is that of injury around the table,\u201d Atif said. \u201cAdults and students alike who are willfully ignorant about others in their midst and under their care.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Several students were glad that the assembly started a conversation about race on campus. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Upper Charlotte Polk, a co-head of ALES, thought senior Kelvin Green II made a strong point when he explained how diversity is also about understanding different perspectives. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, she said the Academy still has a long way to go. \u201cI think [further] diversity training for faculty would really push us further as a diverse prep school,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Prep Janalie Cobb agreed. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great step in the right direction, but there is still more that the administration needs to do to improve,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Prep Eman Noraga appreciated that Tanjong talked about discrimination and harassment of girls who wear hijabs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cAs one of the only hijabi students on campus, it was nice to hear about me for once because not a lot of people talk about issues pertaining to us,\u201d she said, \u201cand it made me realize I don\u2019t necessarily need to have the same race or religion, but I still go through the same stuff they do.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Six students provided their experiences as people of color on campus at Tuesday\u2019s assembly, narrating personal stories in an attempt to illuminate possible areas of improvement for Exeter.

In the last decade, people have become more aware of the issues surrounding food insecurity in America, and we have begun to see more promoters of honest and quality cuisine in our lives. This is new, my friends. The movement has appropriately been dubbed the \u201cGood Food Revolution.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">&#8220;Food is what brings us together, but right now we are letting it rip us apart.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I grew up surrounded by food-lovers. My dad cooks for a living, we rarely shop at the grocery store and we practically live on a farm. The community of rural Berwick, Maine is so unlike anywhere else. By nature rather than force, we are committed to supporting the roots of our food system and eating as directly from the source as we can. It is not only a respectful way to live but also far more healthier for our bodies and relationships. Instead, our country thrives on a food system that is not supportive of its farmers, on food with degraded quality for reduced monetary value and that consequentially leaves the second largest carbon footprint of any country in the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Carbon footprint plays a large role in my dissatisfaction with our current food system. It is deeply disturbing to me that squid caught in Rhode Island must be frozen, packaged and sent to China where it is thawed, processed, refrozen and repackaged, before it is shipped back to the same Rhode Island port to be sold. It is wrong that a mushroom farmer must drive his mushrooms from New Hampshire to Northern Vermont to be inspected, then to Massachusetts to be packaged, in order to legally sell them to his own neighbor. We need to be much more critical. We must question our daily practices, question the rules and regulations put upon us. The fashion in which we raise and deliver our food is not only downright disgusting when thinking about the number of states and countries our food has touched before it reaches our own plates, but also directly plays a role in the grander issue of global climate change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">We need to be wiser when talking about how to solve climate change. Let\u2019s begin to be skeptical of how our every intake and action is affecting the planet. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">What would I like to see change? The people have the power to reform their culture and the legislature that defines it. It\u2019s about time that the problems with America\u2019s food system enter the national spotlight. I would like food insecurity and carbon footprint to be a talking point of the presidential candidates and other politicians from both parties. A legislative reform around food policy would greatly impact our personal health and the health of our planet. The first step is simply realizing the urgency and relevance of this issue. It is something we all contribute to, whether or not we realize it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Food is more than nourishment, and it is surely more than money. Food is connection, tradition and family. It is the practice of people primitively relying on each other, something we desperately need in a world of technology and interpersonal distance. Food is what brings us together, but right now we are letting it rip us apart. Next time you take a fork to hand, please take these thoughts to heart. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the first person you\u2019ve heard to complain about America\u2019s broken food system.

Though I honor these families for their desire to seek justice for their relatives, the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act makes the U.S. more vulnerable in the global arena and undermines our relations with a strategic ally in the Middle East.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">&#8220;Strong diplomatic relations are crucial if we aim to rid the region of its volatility and extremist tendencies.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">As Americans, we pride ourselves in the prestige we carry on the international stage and refuse to confess to our neocolonialist ambitions. The truth is that the U.S. has spurred turmoil and violence across many countries in its efforts to subject them to its vision of government. U.S. interventions in Latin America have resulted in brutal dictatorships and civil unrest. In the 1930s, Franklin Delano Roosevelt helped to install Anastasio Somoza Garc\u00eda as the president of Nicaragua, and then manipulated him to secure U.S. interests. In the 1950s, the United States overthrew the president of Guatemala Jacobo Arbenz to prevent the implementation of a land reform that would endanger American fruit companies. In other cases, the implications of our foreign policy decisions are less noticeable but nevertheless destructive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Before we accuse other countries for their wrongdoings, we must ask ourselves the question: Are we willing to tolerate and fight against reciprocal accusations? Politicians eagerly sign deals that benefit their polling in the short-term without considering long-term repercussions. In March 2002, President George W. Bush imposed tariffs on imported steel to gain support from the steel industries of Pennsylvania, a battleground state. Although Bush intended the tariff to last three years, he cut it thirteen months short when the European Union retaliated with tariffs on American exports from other swing states like Florida. Bush learned that politics can be a zero-sum game. The 9\/11 bill will empower other countries to sue the United States in international courts and seek concessions from our government on major foreign policy issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Indeed, Saudi Arabia has become more erratic and self-centered in the past few years. Its leaders have committed atrocious human rights violations and kept oil prices down in OPEC. Together, with other Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia has nurtured religious extremism in moderate Muslim countries like Bosnia and Albania, promoting a harsh Wahhabi version of Islam. During the Arab Spring, it suppressed rebellion and disturbed the already fragile political systems in Middle Eastern countries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Despite Saudi Arabia\u2019s repugnant actions, the United States should strive to maintain an appropriate relation with the country, given its large supply of crude oil and strategic position on the Arabian Peninsula. Strong diplomatic relations are crucial if we aim to rid the region of its volatility and extremist tendencies. Saudi Arabia has fought against ISIL on many occasions and has taken steps to prevent Saudis from traveling abroad to Iraq. The United States and Saudi Arabia see eye to eye on most methods of counterterrorism, so we should strive to nurture our cooperation on those issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">I believe that JASTA will provoke a myriad of unintended implications. I acknowledge that King Salman does not share the United States\u2019 vision of democracy and human rights, but question whether confrontation with the Saudi monarchy will further our long-term goal of stability in the Middle East or encourage Saudi Arabia to confess to its involvement in 9\/11 attacks. More importantly, JASTA sets a dangerous precedent for international legal institutions by motivating other countries to sue the United States.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Recently, Congress overrode President Obama\u2019s veto on a bill that would allow the families of those killed in 9\/11 to sue Saudi Arabia and other sponsors of international terrorism for their presumed role in the attacks.

In a single run-on sentence that lasted just over two minutes Trump managed to describe in detail how he\u2019d imprison Clinton. Clinton brushed off the comments, joking that she \u201cwouldn\u2019t be the only one in orange.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Trump also attempted to emasculate Clinton by inviting four women who claimed to have been assaulted by her husband, Former President and part-time saxophonist Bill Clinton. \u201cLook at your women.

When asked by the moderators if he was confusing Clinton with her husband, Trump said \u201cI tell it like it is,\u201d and promptly went on a tangent about how Douglas MacArthur would defeat ISIS.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Amidst all the Trump insanity, from calling Clinton the devil to periodically creeping up behind her as he sniffed discreetly, the most shocking event of the evening was not from either candidate. The biggest turn of events was the final question, asked by undecided voter Paul Ryan, a trembling Wisconsin man with wide blue eyes. Shaking as he held the microphone, Ryan asked both candidates \u201cCan each of you say something positive about Donald Trump?\u201d Trump responded with an incoherent monologue bragging about his accomplishments, including but not limited to how he \u201cdestroyed\u201d Rosie O\u2019Donnell and the fact that his fingers are in fact slender, beautiful, and proportional to his body and that he even grew them himself. The undecided voter\u2019s hands shook as he frantically took note of Trump\u2019s words on a yellow legal pad. Clinton, more succinct in her response, told the audience that Trump is \u201cawfully good at handing over elections.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">At press time, Hillary Clinton was leading Donald Trump by 14 points one on one, and leading by 11 points when including third party candidates Gary Johnson, Jill Stein, and Kenneth Bone.<\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>From allegations of indecency to threatening to take their rival as a political prisoner, the second presidential debate on Sunday was a reminder that we are still living inside a reality show even more terrifying than Toddlers &amp; Tiaras.

As we see now, they appear to be merely transforming into a mudslinging popularity contest.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Debates are a chance to show people what candidates are really made of. Not only do they allow potential presidents to express their opinions and ideas, but they also show how they act under pressure. After all, it is tough to get hard questions thrown at you with only two minutes to answer. Debates can change the entire forecast of an election within minutes. However, one could argue that conduct at the podium is more important than what the candidates have to say and could especially argue that it makes or breaks would-be presidential careers.When faced with a loss, I was always taught to be a good sport. My parents told me that it doesn\u2019t matter if you win or lose; it\u2019s how you play the game. I have lived with this philosophy throughout my life. Whether I was playing little league baseball or was participating in a tennis tournament, I was always told to be gracious in victory and even more so in defeat. I had first hand experience with those poor sports who chose not to embody this belief. In the end, those who failed to be courteous to their opponents looked dumb and immature. This general idea of the \u201cGolden Rule\u201d applies just as much to presidential debates.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Even when Mr. Trump spoke at primary Republican debates, whether he won or lost, he always had one go-to excuse at the ready. \u201cIt was rigged.\u201d Excuse me? Saying this wasn\u2019t only childish; it was inexcusably rude to his opponents. In doing so during the primaries, he sought to invalidate them and make their victory less meaningful. A person who cannot acknowledge their own shortcomings or who always has to blame someone else for bad things that transpire in their life is not at all fit to be president. What Mr. Trump needs is some self awareness, and even more importantly, he needs accountability for his mistakes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">However, this \u201cblame others for my errors\u201d mindset is only one aspect of his lack of sportsmanship. During both the debates, we saw both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump were more than happy to interrupt one another\u2014yet one much more so than the other. During the first debate in particular, Mrs. Clinton interrupted Mr. Trump 17 times while Mr. Trump interrupted Mrs. Clinton a whopping 51 times. Just to put this in perspective, during the second debate of the last presidential race (the so-called \u201cInterruption Debate\u201d on October 16, 2012), Mr. Mitt Romney interrupted Mr. Obama 28 times and Mr. Obama interrupted Mr. Romney 36 times. This was considered by many at the time to be appalling and unprecedented, but even these staggering figures pale in comparison to Mr. Trump\u2019s 51 interruptions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Now, what does this tell us about him? It proves even more so that he doesn\u2019t know how to respectfully and actively listen while at the same time showing that he prefers hearing himself over others. On a more important note, is that really how we want a president to behave? At Exeter, one of the first things we were taught as new students was to let the other person voice their opinion first and wait your turn to talk (which, believe it or not, works and makes for great conversations). On top of this, we were taught to never interrupt somebody in the middle of speaking. Without these basic rules, our Harkness classes would fail to be. Unfortunately for him, Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t get this basic human concept of politeness and etiquette and perhaps never will.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">I have a fear that these political debates will become less and less about explaining policies and showing grit. As we see now, they appear to be merely transforming into a mudslinging popularity contest. Looking far, far ahead to the 2020 presidential election, one can only hope that both candidates will exhibit decorum and civility during bitter debates.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>When I watched the first presidential debate on Monday, Sept. 26\u00a0 between Mrs. Hillary Clinton and Mr. Donald Trump, I was struck by the lack of dignity exhibited by one candidate as they both fought it out on the stage.

He doubled down on this line of attack in full force, bringing her husband\u2019s accusers with him to the 2nd presidential debate, holding a press conference with them. He continued to use them as political props throughout the debate itself, going so far as to attempt to seat them in the VIP box next to Bill Clinton purely for the shock effect and spectacle. In condemning Trump\u2019s sexism in the recording, we must also remember to condemn the sexism in his apology. Why should Clinton be responsible for her husband\u2019s past moral digressions? Male politicians are not attacked for their infidelities. After all, Trump himself famously cheated on his first wife with his second wife. Clinton is only being held responsible for her husband\u2019s mistakes because she is a woman. Trump should not be allowed to use sexism to deflect attention away from his own misogyny.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">&#8220;All of this is part of the greater sexism that Clinton faces by virtue of the fact that she is a woman in a country that remains uncomfortable with the idea of empowered women.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Throughout this election cycle, Clinton has been repeatedly attacked due to her husband\u2019s womanizing. During the last debate, Trump utilized the rhetorical technique praeteritio, saying that he was going to attack Clinton on her family life. He then decided to hold back because that would be \u201cnot nice.\u201d Nevertheless, Trump went on to employ a similar tactic on CNN after. Since the release of the tapes, Trump has been relentless with this approach, desperate to deflect attention away from his own clear and disgusting misogyny. Noteable Trump supporter Rudy Giuliani called Clinton \u201cstupid\u201d for believing in and standing by her husband. This is despite the fact that Giuliani left his second wife for his mistress. The hypocrisy is incredible. Men in American politics are allowed to have less than angelic personal lives, but women cannot even be associated with those who have committed some moral wrongdoing. Women are expected to hold themselves to a higher moral standard than men and remain pure and angelic, while \u201cboys will be boys.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">This isn\u2019t to say that Bill Clinton shouldn\u2019t be scrutinized. After committing adultery, he very publicly lied about it. He is obviously no moral angel. He may or may not have raped Juanita Broaddrick and harassed Paula Jones and Kathleen Willey. These women deserve to be recognized and believed until given a reason otherwise. They certainly deserve more than to be used as tools to take down Clinton. Nevertheless, Bill Clinton is not Hillary Clinton. Bill Clinton\u2019s poor character is not a reflection on Hillary Clinton\u2019s character. It\u2019s certainly not a reflection on her policy opinions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">All of this is part of the greater sexism that Clinton faces by virtue of the fact that she is a woman in a country that remains uncomfortable with the idea of empowered women. The constant attacks concerning her health, the insinuation that she is too weak, too fragile or frail to be president and Trump\u2019s droning on how Clinton doesn\u2019t have enough stamina are all rhetoric centered around the idea that men are stronger than women. Time and time again Clinton is defined by her femininity. She\u2019s not just a presidential candidate, she\u2019s a female presidential candidate. Clinton has faced disgusting sexism throughout her presidential campaign, and we must not forget that as we condemn Trump\u2019s misogyny.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important;

Instead of facilitating respectable discourse, the candidates attacked each other personally and with no focus on their actual policy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">It also became apparent during Sunday\u2019s debate that both Hillary and Donald have fundamental, fail-safe issues they fall back on in almost every response. For Trump, it\u2019s ISIS and Hillary\u2019s emails. For Hillary, it\u2019s Donald\u2019s tax returns and a casual, cynical laughter to assure us of how false Trump\u2019s statements are.The big question going into the debate was how Donald Trump would respond to the tapes released last Friday. Trump knew this and it showed. His first few minutes where awkward; he stood straight and uncomfortable; he held himself like a freshman visiting the principal\u2019s office for the first time. He made no sense when he spoke, making nonexistent connections between ISIS and his own vulgarity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">But the question we all have after one of these debates is this: Who won?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I could talk about which candidate expressed the greatest knowledge of their policy. I could talk about which candidate defended their viewpoints the best. Or I could talk about whose hair looked better, or who had a better outfit. The answer would be the same for each. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Neither.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The truth is that these debates aren\u2019t changing minds. They\u2019re reaffirming prior judgements. No one goes into these 2016 Presidential Debates wondering about policy. They\u2019ve become solely entertainment. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Neither Trump nor Clinton deserves to be our president. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">But if there\u2019s one thing Donald\u2019s right about, it\u2019s that our country needs fresh leadership. Of the 320 million people in our country are there really none more qualified to lead?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">According to a Gallup poll, 25 percent of the United States is dissatisfied with both candidates. By the same report, that\u2019s more than twice the joint dissatisfaction in 2012 and four times that of 2008. So what does this growing disapproval of the presidential candidates mean?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">It means that something has to change. A recent video by Vox News proposes radical new ideas about our presidential debates.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">According to the video, the main problem with the debates is the live audience. Candidates like Donald Trump feed off of interaction with the audience, and play to them to manipulate the viewers at home. While the moderators do encourage the audience to be silent, that is utterly unrealistic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s the live audience that promotes personal attacks, snide quips, purely reactionary remarks and the proliferation of interruption. It\u2019s the live audience that pulls the focus away from policy and onto performance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Another improvement offered by Vox is the use of a chess clock for speaking time. This would force candidates to allot their time more appropriately and would discourage interruption and pointless ramble. It would also work to condense the candidates remarks and hopefully focus them on the question asked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The need for intellectual, informative debates is an absolute necessity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">As Alexander Hamilton said, \u201cAll communities divide themselves into the few and the many. The first are the rich and well-born, the other the mass of the people. The voice of the people has been said to be the voice of God; and however generally this maxim has been quoted and believed, it is not true in fact. The people are turbulent and changing; they seldom judge or determine right.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Let\u2019s avoid the thin line our Founding Fathers walked as they vouched for the suppression of democracy within the poor and working classes. Instead, let\u2019s embrace the people. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Let\u2019s not call them a \u201cbasket of deplorables,\u201d or demean women and minorities. Instead, let\u2019s inform our voting population. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Let\u2019s not create debates in which the winner is the candidate with the best zinger or the best, longest, most strategic interruption. Instead, let\u2019s reform our debates.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">If we hope to create a respectable political system, we need an election process that reflects everything we stand for as a nation. We need an election process that represents the people, informs the people and most of all, is for the people.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Sunday night\u2019s debate was even more despicable than the first.

Upper Daisy Tichenor, a member of DRAMAT, found the event to be a major success. \u201cFish Fest doesn\u2019t pretend to be a major dance like Back in Black or Whiteout. It\u2019s a more casual environment, and obviously people dress up in 80s clothes. There\u2019s much less pressure on people who attend.\u201d Tichenor stressed the fact that Fish Fest doesn\u2019t necessarily adhere to a mosh pit style of dancing, but rather just provides a venue to enjoy one\u2019s time with friends.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The dance started off slowly, but as more people checked out the scene, many seemed to appreciate the somewhat unfamiliar style of the dance. Senior Maya Pierce said, \u201cEveryone knows 80s music but doesn\u2019t like to admit it. When people are dressed up in ridiculous outfits and listening to music they might be a bit embarrassed to know, it brings out a different side of people.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThey realize everyone else knows and loves these songs too, and people can let loose and not worry as much about how they look and focus on just dancing, singing and having fun,\u201d Pierce added.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cIt was really fun to see everyone decked out in 80s clothing and listening to 80s music is always a blast.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Board member and interim cohead of DRAMAT Senior Nada Zohayr simply put it, \u201cThe dance is successful because it\u2019s a fun chance to wear neon and dance like you\u2019re Madonna.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">DRAMAT spent the majority of time preparing for the dance through advertisement.s. The club\u2019s members put up posters, invited Exonians through a Facebook event, announced the dance at Assembly and sent out a school-wide email. On the night itself, organizers inflateda large number of beach balls and put up decorations. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">DRAMAT member and upper George Matheos found the dance to be successful, but not flawless. \u201cQuite a few people came and it seemed like they were all having a great time, and I\u2019d say that those were successes.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Many members of the group don\u2019t know where the 80s theme originated, but it has shown to be an enjoyable tradition that DRAMAT continues to support for their allotted dance. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI enjoyed it, though I happen to also like dances more similar to Back in Black as well,\u201d Matheos said. He also noted that the dance was more interesting as it wasn\u2019t the standard mosh pit type, which certainly made it more enjoyable for people who don\u2019t like that compact style of dance. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Although the event was a great way for students to unwind for the weekend, Fish Fest did find some technical difficulties throughout the night as the DJ was booked for the wrong weekend. Thus, DRAMAT students resorted to kicking off the dance with a Spotify playlist they found; however, it seemed that many dancers were not completely into it. As a result, Director of Student Activities Joanne Lembo along with Tichenor, Pierce and Matheos DJ&#8217;d for the night by queueing songs on their own with special requests from dancers in the crowd. The group put together suggestions of the many 80s songs that they liked and played them in sequence. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Matheos explained that the process did not go perfectly smoothly, as there were a few times when songs were accidentally switched to the next track and the gaps in between resulted in some awkward moments for dancers waiting for the transition to end. \u201cBut overall, the crowd seemed much happier with the music from this point onwards, and the dance became much more lively,\u201d Matheos said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Tichenor agreed. \u201cOnce we started choosing well known songs people really started dancing and having fun,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Pierce added, \u201cAll things considered, I think we did a good job.

Trump announced his candidacy for President of the United States. At the time, many didn\u2019t believe Trump had the ability to make it far in the race, dismissing his campaign as a long shot. His shocking remarks regarding the Mexican government sending over \u201crapists\u201d shocked all that opposed him, even furthering their belief that Trump\u2019s campaign would soon dissolve. Yet the rhetoric continued. Seeming to offend everyone, he has made comments about women, war heroes, race, Islam, Judaism and his own children, saying Ivanka was a \u201chot piece of a**.\u201d This leaves me wondering who can support him at all. When is enough, enough?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Donald Trump has made two world religions targets of his attacks. His assaults against Islam are by far the most shocking. His most infamous statement, \u201cIslam hates us,\u201d was just one of many comments that generalized and stereotyped the religion and its followers. Donald also plans to take drastic measures in order to stop \u201cRadical Islamic Terrorism\u201d including banning all Muslims from traveling to the United states and creating a Muslim-American database. The highly offensive language Trump uses and the extreme policies he has laid out regarding Muslims are not to be taken lightly. Islam is not the only religion that Donald Trump has targeted, however. On the official Donald Trump twitter account, an image of Hillary Clinton was posted, captioned \u201cCrooked Hillary\u2014Makes History!\u201d In the background of the image were multiple 100 dollar bills and \u201cMost Corrupt Candidate\u201d placed in the star of David. This tweet perpetuated the stereotype of Jews being greedy with their money, hence the use of the six pointed star. The comments that were made by Trump offend all Muslims and Jews, as well as anyone who follows a religion.From the instance of telling a female contestant on The Apprentice that she would \u201clook good on her knees,\u201d to calling Rosie O\u2019Donnell a \u201cpig,\u201d to suggesting Fox News reporter Megyn Kelly was menstruating, Donald Trump has proven time and time again he disrespects women. In addition to his recent comments, a video of Trump in 2005 speaking horrendously of women has been released just this past week. Language so vulgar was used that it lead even Trump himself to make what seems to be his first apology of the race. The derogatory remarks towards women should discourage anyone, especially females, to vote for Donald.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Never before has there been a presidential candidate that has stereotyped and affronted ethnicities, races, religions, genders and individuals like Donald Trump. The sheer lack of respect for everyone who is not like him is astounding, as shown in his comparison of golf to gay marriage: \u201cIt\u2019s like in golf. A lot of people\u2014I don\u2019t want this to sound trivial\u2014but a lot of people are switching to these really long putters, very unattractive. It\u2019s weird. You see these great players with these really long putters because they can\u2019t sink three-footers anymore. And I hate it. I am a traditionalist. I have so many fabulous friends who happen to be gay, but I am a traditionalist.\u201d Recently, Trump has decreased the amount of abhorrent comments. Some may say it is in an attempt to become more presidential, but the issue for Trump is that there are no more people to discriminate against! He has covered all of the bases. Yet support for Donald remains rampant in our country, leaving me to ask when is enough, enough?<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Our nation started going down a road of darkness on June 16, 2015: the day Donald J.

The conflict has claimed 220,000 lives and displaced millions, utilizing extortion and radicalizing youth. Fueled by the cocaine trade, it is believed to be one of the richest rebel movements in the world. The opposition, spearheaded by ex-president \u00c1lvaro Uribe, believes the measures of the peace deal are too lenient, allowing murderers, criminals and drug cartels to infiltrate the government and threaten national security and social stability. As one opponent of the deal told <i>The New York Times<\/i>, \u201clet them be punished by serving jail terms, sir. And don\u2019t give them any money. I wake up at 4 a.m. every morning in order to earn 689,000 pesos (about 200 dollars) and they were being paid for doing nothing, for committing crimes, because they\u2019re not going to give up vice just like that.\u201dIn the latest chapter of a blood soaked political narrative, Colombia shocked the world by voting \u201cno\u201d to a peace deal with the FARC (The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) that established a permanent ceasefire and negotiations to neutralize radical groups. The deal also offered judicial leniency and some economic cushioning for FARC members to cut drug trafficking. The plan is a diplomatic trailblazer, finely constructed to emphasize unity and peace, pledged to reinvigorate a neutral, non-polar political discourse and set the foundations for a new national identity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Ironically, the most distrust was harboured by those least affected. <i>The New York Times<\/i> quotes <i>The Colombian<\/i> news website, La Silla Vacia, citing the Foundation for Peace and Reconciliation report \u201cthat in 67 of the 81 municipalities most affected by the conflict, Yes, was the winner.\u201d Geographically speaking the bulk of \u201cNo\u201d voters are collected in the center of the country in urban centers not as affected by the FARC conflict. El Tiempo, a Colombian newspaper, reports that 50.2 percent of people voted \u201cNo\u201d and 49.7 percent voted \u201cYes,\u201d mirroring Brexit in terms of margin and polarization. The FARC, born out of the period of censorship and military leadership and clenching of conservative power following Colombia\u2019s civil war represent a stagnant, defective political arena. One founded in fragmentation, turmoil and ideological factions forming a part of both Colombian legacy and founding a popular struggle. Urban opposition groups, prompted by the ex-president\u2019s philosophies, are believed to have been swayed by the perception that the peace deal is a step toward \u201cCastro-Chavismo,\u201d referring to systematic communist takeover.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">This is a powerful fear for citizens seeking economic freedom and success as well as democratic process. Despite this, El Tiempo also notes that only 37.4 percent, 20 million people, voted. Why? Is there a lack of democratic faith, a failure to commit to a vehicle designed to bring peace and social restoration? Headed by a leader in the UN spotlight, commended for orchestrating solutions most in touch with diplomatic values, who fails to convince his own people of the pact\u2019s own political efficacy? Fear can\u2019t entirely explain the failure to vote as populous urban centers, with the smallest FARC presence, must represent a significant number of those who didn\u2019t vote. Why is the Western world more convinced than the Colombian citizens themselves? <i>The New York Times <\/i>ran an article crediting this as \u201cProof that (Colombian) Democracy Doesn\u2019t Work,\u201d and lamenting the South American country\u2019s newest defeat of good conscience.

Nobles was undefeated going into the game, so Exeter had their work cut out for them. After a stalemate in regular time, with both teams managing to score one goal, the game went into overtime. Unfortunately for the home team, Nobles was able to score the first goal in extra time and end the game.<\/p>\n<p>Big Red suffered a tough loss to Brewster earlier in the week, and they were hoping to bounce back and play hard against Nobles. The girls knew that they would need to play their best game of the season against such fierce competition, and that is exactly what they did.<\/p>\n<p>Sticking with the ferocious Nobles team was no easy task. Exeter\u2019s opponents provided many threats from all over the field, but the team\u2019s defense stepped up to the challenge. Lower Catherine Griffin noted that, \u201c[Nobles was] good at keeping the ball on the offensive end. The game was very tiring because we spent most of the time playing defense.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Big Red\u2019s defense worked well together and gave everything they had, making it very tough for Nobles to create opportunities. Lower Katie Young had another great game as goalie and blocked\u00a0 all but one of the shots that were fired at her.<\/p>\n<p>Although the girls spent the majority of the game on defense, their offense also played extremely well. The team\u2019s chemistry was crucial for them as they were able to string together good passes and take solid shots on net. Prep Emma Watson explained that, \u201cOn offense [they] were more aggressive than usual and played with a very team oriented goal: to nuke Nobles.\u201d The girls peppered the Nobles goalie with shots on multiple possessions and they eventually found the back of the net.<\/p>\n<p class=\"pullquote\">\u201cWe made one little mistake. Two defenders went for the ball and they passed it to the open player who scored.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At halftime, the girls were elated to be keeping up with Nobles and gritted through the second half of the game to force it into overtime. Usually, a game is played with 11 players on either side, but in overtime each team can only play with seven players. Also, the game is decided by a golden goal, which means that the first team to score will win the game.<\/p>\n<p>Coach Pacific said that overtime, \u201cGives a lot of time and a lot of space. They usually end pretty quickly and that\u2019s what happened with us.\u201d She later noted that, \u201cWe made one little mistake. Two defenders went for the ball and they passed it to the open player who scored.\u201d Even though Exeter lost the game, they still have many things to be proud of.<\/p>\n<p>Big Red field hockey will look to continue their strong play this weekend.

Our bees are thriving now, following a very eventful summer of trying to establish the hive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In late May, the queen bee was laying so many larvae (called \u201cbrood\u201d) that we had to add another box (called a \u201csuper\u201d) to the top of the hive, in effort to encourage the bees to pull more honeycomb and make room for her. In early July, the beehive seemed to be in good shape, with lots of brood and plenty of pollen and nectar to be turned into honey. We saw a few swarm queen cells (worker bees trying to make a new queen bee), which explains why we were unable to locate the queen during at the time. We believe that half of the hive swarmed a few days after July 4, probably due to a lack of space. To help, we added another super.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Although we still could not find the queen for the next couple of weeks, eggs and larvae of all ages indicated that there was a new queen actively procreating. However, we also saw an abundance of male bees, called \u201cdrones,\u201d which usually means that there is a \u201claying worker\u201d\u2014not a good sign. A laying worker is a regular bee who tries to help out in the absence of a queen bee, but can only produce drones since only the queen bee can produce females. Drone bees do nothing for the hive other than consume resources, mate with the queen and attract mites. Long story short, their numerous presence was concerning. Fortunately, it is easy to detect a drone brood as opposed to a regular brood within a hive. Drone bees are longer, so the brood cells are rounded on top, creating a popcorn-esque look. To combat the excess of drones and protect our hive from mites and loss of resources, we used a fork to open drone cells that had not yet hatched.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">By the middle of July, due to the presence of so many drones, irregular brood patterns and general lack of organization in the hive, we concluded that the hive was queenless. We ordered a new nucleus colony (a queen bee and about 10,000 bees), and blended it with our hive. By placing a piece of newspaper between the old hive and the nucleus colony, the bees are given time to adjust to each other as they eat through the newspaper to open the hive back up. Interestingly, the new nucleus colony that we got was actually a different breed of bees than our original hive. It was very interesting to see two different breeds of bees in there for a few weeks, before the new queen\u2019s breed took over the population entirely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One of the characteristics of our new breed of bees, the Carniolan, is that they are well adapted to surviving the winter. They cut down to a small winter bee population, and form a very tight \u201ccluster\u201d around the queen to keep her warm. All honeybees utilize this cluster formation to keep the queen bee at about 95 degrees, but cluster size is important, because fewer winter bees means the hive is less likely to run out of food storage before the winter is over<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the next few weeks, we will begin insulating our hive for the winter. The most important thing is to protect the bees from wind, so we will place hay bales on the North and East sides of the hive. We will also make sure they have enough honey stores to last them a few months, and if we feel that they don\u2019t, we will provide them with extra food.

He said of President Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare reform, \u201cSo you\u2019ve got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have health care and then the people who are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. It\u2019s the craziest thing in the world.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Bill\u2019s Obamacare comments also reveal a bigger underlying question: Is Bill Clinton a good surrogate for Hillary? Does he not want Hillary to be elected so he doesn\u2019t have to deal with the agonizing problem of giving a title to his position as the president\u2019s husband? With her meticulously crafted image, it\u2019s hard to imagine that Hillary or her campaign team would be happy with Bill\u2019s various comments, especially comments that don\u2019t align with Hillary\u2019s positions. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway recently called Bill their campaign\u2019s \u201cbest surrogate,\u201d yet again confirming fears that Bill is just not as competent a Hillary surrogate as people like Michelle Obama or John Podesta.Although Clinton later tried to rectify his mistake, the damage was done. His statement was shocking to hear, as Hillary has repeatedly stated her support for Obamacare: \u201cAs president, I\u2019ll defend the Affordable Care Act, build on its successes, and go even further to reduce costs.\u201d Bill Clinton\u2019s assertion wasn\u2019t a fair one. Yes, Obamacare has its negative aspects. Still, I don\u2019t agree with the way he phrased his displeasure with Obama\u2019s health care policy. You cannot disregard the good it has done for so many people and call it \u201cthe craziest thing in the world.\u201d Yes, Bill Clinton was right in saying that a lot of people dislike the individual mandate aspect of Obamacare as well as possible out-of-pocket costs. It has sparked anger in people who almost qualify for the government subsidies but don\u2019t. However, the uninsured rate for the first quarter of 2015 was 11.9 percent. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2013, the rate was 5.1 points higher, at 17 percent. According to a survey from The Commonwealth Fund, 86 percent of people who were \u201cinsured through Obamacare or newly insured in Medicaid\u201d were very or somewhat satisfied with their healthcare coverage, while 62 percent of respondents reported that they previously wouldn\u2019t have been able to obtain or afford their current care. More actions have to be undertaken to expand access to insurance, but Obamacare has done a fairly decent job. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">His comments could easily be used as Republican ammunition against Hillary in this enormously consequential election. The Republican National Committee has already sent out mailers in swing states saying, \u201cBill Clinton finally tells the truth\u2026 and it\u2019s not going to help Hillary.\u201d Trump has also addressed the incident, thanking Bill for \u201cbeing honest.\u201d Although that definitely wasn\u2019t his intention, Bill may have ended up helping Trump with the bad timing of his comment. With only one month until the general election, that might have been especially damaging. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Recently, while campaigning for Hillary in Flint, Mich., Bill Clinton used a few choice words to describe Obamacare.

Papadakis echoed this, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s a tactic to help us perform well and get the lowest overall score.\u201d So far, it has been working, but the runners must implement \u201cblobbing\u201d in practices in order to have it work in the real races.<\/p>\n<p>Although last week was a grind for girls\u2019 cross country, this week was much more relaxing. There was no meet on Saturday, so instead the team went on a 10-mile hike in Franconia. Papadakis thought the hike was \u201creally fun,\u201d and explained that although it provided endurance training, the hike also created an opportunity for a team bonding. They will be away next week racing against Northfield Mount Hermon school for their parents\u2019 weekend.<\/p>\n<p>Papadakis anticipates the NMH race will be difficult, saying that historically they have been known for their tough and hilly course, but that Exeter is prepared to meet this challenge. \u201cOur coaches have been training us for these types of courses and we practiced hill repeats last week so I think we are all ready and very capable of doing well,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>Senior Annie Yanofsky expressed the same concern for the terrain at Northfield Mount Hermon. \u201cThey [NMH] have the advantage of racing their home course because it is really hilly and they have been practicing on it.

There are 12 people sitting with you: 11 students, one teacher. You\u2019re discussing a reading most of you completed the night before. It\u2019s not the greatest topic in the world, but it was mildly interesting when you read it and has been entertaining enough to sustain your interest in trying to untangle its meaning. You\u2019re really looking forward to your free period, though, and your mind is wandering a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Exeter does its best to gather a well-rounded and cosmopolitan student body. It\u2019s one of the great things about our school; in the middle of rural New England, a community of over 1,000 kids from just as many backgrounds attend school and learn to live with each other. Exeter also has the capacity and audacity to throw you into a classroom of people with whom you would likely never interact. Here, they expect you to engage with your peers and run a Harkness discussion with them, no matter your thoughts on their thoughts. They do this because part of the Harkness process is dealing with people\u2019s differing opinions, including fundamental differences in worldview. By learning to connect with people you don\u2019t naturally relate to, you are learning to be a stronger leader and a more effective communicator.Then, out of nowhere, that annoying kid goes and drags their inflammatory views into the discussion and injects the reading with their uncultured interpretations of the world. What do you do? You probably shot them a subtly snarky comment and complained about them at lunch. This is not the best way to handle an obtuse person at the Harkness table. You know you should converse with them and try to understand their viewpoint while emphasizing your own, but it\u2019s a lot easier to talk to your friends about them and more satisfying to send a zinger his or her way. In doing so, however, you are limiting the effectiveness of the teaching style that we as a community have embraced. There are a couple of things to keep in mind when you are engaging with such a person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Knowing this, you may be able to let that person\u2019s insensitive beliefs slide, just a little. However, other kinds of interactions might be more challenging. After you leave your history class, you encounter the opposite problem in English\u2014the discussion is dead. You and some others try time and again to rejuvenate it, but you talk only to blank faces. Without hurting your classmate\u2019s feelings or griping about them later, you must encourage them to participate. Sometimes it is a simple prod at the table; other times the entire class must be restructured, or even spend time outside of class to get to know each other better. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Harkness, in all its functional and dysfunctional forms, goes beyond the table and the people sitting at it. It is an institution by itself, separate from Exeter and much farther reaching in its scope. It is a tool that has educated high schoolers for over 80 years and will continue to teach them after you have graduated. It collectively carries everyone to higher and higher levels of excellence in a way that lecture-style teaching cannot. Honing everyone\u2019s talents and soft points will drive the discussion to further clarity. Helping fix the toxic history class or stagnant English discussions in a positive way will help you learn better, too. Focusing on their flaws will weigh the discussion down and keep everyone from learning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">I fully expect you to continue to dislike other people\u2019s opinions and groan about other people\u2019s silence. I do, too. It\u2019s a part of human nature. However, remembering the reasons behind Harkness and focusing on these ideals rather than the details of how they play out with one another may keep us from sliding into frustration and missed opportunity.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>You\u2019re in your history class, sitting around one of those big old Harkness tables with little pictures and people\u2019s names carved into it.

The loss ended the team\u2019s 7-0 winning streak, making their record 8-1.<\/p>\n<p>The team entered their games this weekend with confidence, due to their success against Choate last week. \u201cGoing in the game we were feeling good, coming off the big win against Choate. We felt really strong,\u201d senior and captain JP Mullins said.<\/p>\n<p>However, the team was also aware of Brunswick\u2019s reputation, having only lost one game in the last three seasons. \u201cWe knew this team was really good. They have only lost 1 game in the past three seasons and so we knew it was going to be a fight,\u201d Mullins said.<\/p>\n<p>The team let this reputation get to their heads slightly, causing Brunswick to gain an early lead, ultimately winning 11-2. \u201cThey were really good and just played much more intensity than we did.

Some starters also earned fouls, which was detrimental to the whole team.

The team won easily, with a final score of 16-3.<\/p>\n<p>Exeter\u2019s success in that match allowed the team to put in their younger players, to get insight on the depth of the team. This served as good practice and preparation for the preps and lowers. \u201cFor [the younger players], this was the best practice they could\u2019ve gotten because there is no substitution for actually playing the game of water polo in a competitive setting,\u201d upper Will Soltas said.<\/p>\n<p>Although the loss to Brunswick and the end of their winning streak was disappointing to the team, they left the tournament with a clearer idea on how to improve and a determination to do so. \u201cOn our drive home, of course, we were all feeling down having lost our streak. But you could tell everyone was thinking of ways to improve not only themselves but the entire team and our play style,\u201d Soltas said.<\/p>\n<p>Walshe felt that the game served to humble the team after a long streak of easy wins. \u201cWe got pretty cocky after whooping a bunch of easy teams during the beginning of the season so the Brunswick loss is a nice reality check,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>The Brunswick loss highlighted specific aspects of the team\u2019s gameplay to improve. \u201cOnce we get some kinks out of our playing, as well as become stronger in the pool and adjust our offence, I\u2019m sure we can eliminate, or at least reduce the ejections that ultimately cost us the game,\u201d said Soltas.<\/p>\n<p>Bear Polo is optimistic and is determined to come back from the loss better than before. \u201cBrunswick opened up some obvious holes in both our play style and training regiment, but I\u2019m sure if we solidify ourselves as the end of the season draws near, we will definitely be a formidable force going into the championship tournament,\u201d Soltas said.<\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Boys\u2019 water polo lost their undefeated streak this weekend, winning against Canterbury and losing against Brunswick.

Well, we have good news for you: Kenzo is collaborating with H&amp;M! The lookbook was recently released, displaying an array of clothing filled with animal prints and colorful patterns. Carol Lim and Humberto Leon, the creative directors for Kenzo, have not only designed amazing clothing pieces, but they have also designed statement accessories such as the animal boots and long leather gloves with a printed Kenzo logo. The collaboration is going to be released next month on Nov. 3 in 250 H&amp;M stores and online as well. These collaborations are normally sold out in a flash and resold for more than double the price, so make sure you have a good plan if you want to own one of Lim and Leon\u2019s amazing designs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Paris Fashion Week officially ended last week, and we have updates on the shoes that were everywhere on the cobbled streets of Paris. This PFW was all about the white shoes, especially white-pointed heels and boots that were commonly spotted with cropped jeans and basic-colored trousers. Combat boots were worn by many fashionistas attending the shows; however, they were not the traditional combat boots we would imagine. The combat boots that adorned the feet of many of the famous fashion show attendees either had heels or a unique pattern\/shape to them. Metallics were also a favorite during this fashion week. Metallic shoes were spotted in many colors and designs, such as the silver metallic boots and the gold Gucci Princetown slippers. Last but not least, we like to give a shout out to the ubiquitous platform shoes that not only helped many fashionistas stand out from the crowd, but also probably helped them stay comfortable as well. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This week, <b>Gracie Williams \u201917<\/b> looked chic with her white sweater, leather mini skirt and black pointed ankle boots. <b>Molly O\u2019Day \u201918 <\/b>stuck with the basics in her leather jacket, black top, denim jeans and white sneakers. <b>Ricky Lee \u201917<\/b> kept it casual in his biker pants, black t-shirt, white button-down shirt and black Adidas NMD sneakers. <b>Jamie Lowell \u201920<\/b> was looking very well-dressed with a checkered blue button-down shirt. <b>Walter Thilly \u201917<\/b> has been catching everyone\u2019s eye lately with his interesting mixing and matching of the sports clothes he always wears. We\u2019re glad he found his missing hat\u2014we couldn\u2019t tell it was him without it on. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A message from Connor: <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Following on what I stated last week, there is a very big difference in terms of style between Americans and Europeans. Many Europeans attempt to dress like their image of an \u201cAmerican.\u201d But these distorted Instagram accounts that post pictures of \u201cAmerican Style\u201d are not really what Americans wear. In the United States, teenagers in all different areas dress differently. In New England, people wear very generic brands such as Brooks Brothers, Vineyard Vines and Patagonia. This is also largely influenced by the weather. In Florida, people do not tend to wear generic brands, but just simple t-shirts and shorts. Nowadays in New York City, any object covering your body is a new and trendy piece of clothing. This hipster sensation has been an interesting new revolution to see, the heart of it being in New York City. In conclusion, there is no standard dress for American teenagers it is different all over the country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Stay stylish, <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Connor &amp; Tanya <\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Hey guys!

Their articles helped fuel major discussions about how to improve the climate of elite private schools and will hopefully create a much safer environment on our campuses. That being said, their articles about the cases of a graduated senior and the lawsuit brought against the school by a student who withdrew, are journalistic abominations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">&#8220;Instead, they write suggestive pieces that present one-sided arguments and plant ideas in the minds of readers who don\u2019t read critically enough to form their own opinions.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Perhaps the largest distortion of the situation came in an article attacking Reverend Thompson about his actions in the latest assault case, as well as ones dating back to 1993. The article had the tone of comparing his actions with those of the Catholic priests <i>The Globe<\/i>\u2019s spotlight team has become famous for exposing. In her article, Ms. Abelson begins with a character assassination and seems to overlook the fact that it is a minister\u2019s duty to offer counsel and spiritual guidance to any and all students. I, unlike Ms. Abelson, will not speak for Reverend Thompson, but it seems to me that he felt he was doing right, in his eyes and according to his religion. I believe that he holds himself to a different set of policies, divine rules. This view may have led him to make mistakes in the handling of this case, but certainly not malice-driven mistakes.The articles have a distinct bias that seeks to blame the administration and portray the involved parties as completely incompetent. The only input from the Academy is through lawyers due to the lawsuits against the administrations and investigation of some deans. This means that the administration is legally obligated to remain silent about the cases until their conclusion. Consequently, <i>The Globe<\/i> prints articles without allowing the school to set the record straight and tell their side of the story. Instead, they write suggestive pieces that present one-sided arguments and plant ideas in the minds of readers who don\u2019t read critically enough to form their own opinions. The actions of the people involved in handling the accusations of sexual assault are taken out of context, blowing a mistake out of proportion and showing the most damaging side. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The deans handling of the most recent sexual assault case, and Reverend Thompson, mishandled the claims of the victim and failed to address the issue quick enough. There is no question that the process and policies surrounding these circumstances were faulty and to some extent disregarded. However, there is a value we hold in this country that we deemed so important it became the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution. This is the right to a trial before an impartial jury, and the right to representation. This may not be taking place in a courthouse, but it is taking place in a world of spectacularly unbalanced scales. In the media, the school has not been afforded impartial judgement and the reporters preyed on this story at a time when half of the parties involved were unable to respond, unable to represent themselves. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">In spite of <i>The Boston Globe\u2019<\/i>s questionable method of journalism, their inquiries into the issues that plague not just private schools, but most educational institutions, made a discourse possible about a topic that isn\u2019t easy to bring up, let alone discuss. As a result, the Academy has rushed to implement clear protocols for dealing with issues that arise, and more importantly, preventing further assaults by fundamentally changing the culture. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">This rash of cases have raised awareness for the victims, both present and past, and opened our eyes to the struggle they faced speaking out, and the difficulties they will have moving forward. The long-lasting effect will be a change in the culture of all of our schools and hopefully the prevention of any future assaults. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>We are all well aware of the intense scrutiny of The Boston Globe on our school concerning the barrage of unearthed sexual assault cases that have shaken our community.

It will most likely be an exhausting and mind-numbing experience. Students will forego sleep and free time in preparation. But SWAT teams will not be deployed to guard the tests, retina scans will not be administered, cheating will not result in seven years of jail time. The same cannot be said for the situation in China.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In a society which places such great value on higher education, a Chinese student\u2019s college education\u2014therefore their score on the gaokao\u2014has a huge influence on his or her future. Good results on the test tend to have a profound impact on not only the student\u2019s future career prospects, but their economic and social standing. Additionally, due to China\u2019s former one-child policy, many test takers are only children who will someday be the sole economic provider for their household. All of these factors have fused together to create unreasonably high stakes and a test-obsessed school culture, resulting in an obsessive need for students to succeed on the gaokao. The gaokao has monopolized the academic and social lives of chinese teens. Well-rounded, emotionally healthy lifestyles are forfeited for constant test prep. One Chinese high school sparked international concern a couple years ago when photos leaked of students in class receiving amino acids through IV drips to boost test performance and fight exhaustion. The leading cause of suicide in high school and middle school age children in China is test stress. As if the stakes weren\u2019t high enough already, as of 2014 cheating on the gaokao is a criminal offense that can result in up to seven years in prison.The college admissions process in China is composed entirely of an SAT-like exam. Called the <i>gaokao<\/i>, it\u2019s administered exclusively to seniors nationwide during the last three days of high school. Students sit for four different exams over the course of three days: Chinese, English, mathematics and an elective of either science or humanities, which essentially forces students to designate their future major and career track even before high school graduation. By the end of the month, the Department of Education will release test results in the form of national and regional rankings. The top-scoring students will be admitted into the top universities, second tier students will be admitted into second tier universities, and so on down the list until each spot has been filled. This year, 9.4 million students nationwide competed for 3 million undergraduate spots.There are no Common Apps, no essays, no extracurriculars or teacher recommendations that are taken into account. Students are reduced to a test score and sorted accordingly. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">China\u2019s Department of Education is no longer able to ignore the ramifications of this cultural obsession with the gaokao. However, test\u2019s deep historical and cultural significance has proven it incredibly hard to reform. 15 years or so after its creation in 1952, the gaokao was shut down during the cultural revolution due to the systematic shutdown of Chinese universities. When it was reinstated in 1977, it signified a new era of academic opportunity for Chinese students. A system which was hypothetically devoid of any political or socioeconomic bias, allocating opportunities based entirely on academic merit of the student. It\u2019s an appealing ideology even in America today, where so much of our college application process is dependent on legacy and connections. But the gaokao has its fair share of systematic biases. Due to its method of region-by-region test administration, students in Beijing- often children of political leaders, party members or international businessmen- receive an easier version of the test than their counterparts in more rural and poorer provinces. Wealthier families can expend massive amounts of resources hiring live in tutors and former test takers to help their children prepare. The gaokao is so integral to the bureaucratic and cultural aspects of Chinese education that it is unlikely the test will ever be fully abolished. In fact, international universities have begun accepting gaokao scores or even implementing their own similar system. But China\u2019s Department of Education has encouraged schools to start taking a comprehensive look at students, by awarding \u201cbonus points\u201d on the gaokao for exemplary achievements, extra curriculars, and teacher recommendations. They have worked with universities to expand their student resources and undergraduate intake. But such marginal measures cannot fix such a deeply flawed system. High school students should not be required to choose between their mental, emotional and physical health or their future. China\u2019s college admissions system in a broken one and needs dramatic reform now, for their student\u2019s sake. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>In a few weeks, Exeter students across all grades will file into EHS to take the SAT on Nov. 5.

It\u2019s Alyssa, one of the co-heads of Active Minds, an ESSO club dedicated to raising mental health awareness around campus. I started going to this club to hear people discuss the mental health climate at Exeter after attending the Active Mind\u2019s assembly my prep year; I realized that having a mental health disorder is more common than I thought\u2014Exeter is a very demanding and stressful place, and problems ranging from social to school issues can affect our mental health.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, too often these mental health illnesses and disorders are swept under the rug. People will brush them off by telling others to toughen up and stop acting like a child, or even joke about having a mental health disorder. The stigma surrounding mental health issues cause many to be afraid of admitting or talking about their health with their peers and trusted adults. What most students don\u2019t realize is that mental health is a big issue that affects people\u2019s lives and is rarely a lone person\u2019s struggle. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Oct. 3 marked the National Day Without Stigma. Stigma is defined as a mark of disgrace associated with a particular circumstance, quality or person. Mental health illnesses, especially anxiety, OCD and depression, are often associated with negative connotations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Because of a lack of mental health awareness, many people get treated differently and are discriminated if they are open about their illnesses. Stereotypes of people suffering from mental health disorders include them being weak, scary and even dangerous. I know, from personal experience, that students feel ashamed to walk up to the third floor of the health center to visit a counselor. But we shouldn\u2019t feel this way. We\u2019re all human, and we all have problems. There should be no shame in wanting to talk or getting help with our problems. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Therefore, as a club, we are trying to help remove the stigma by openly talking about mental health in a safe environment. We discuss various types of mental health disorders and how it affects our daily lives. To raise awareness, we also deliberate on what the school can do to foster a better culture and plan events to involve more of the student body. This term, we are planning an event to \u201cStamp Out Stigma\u201d and this coming January, we are having a speaker at Assembly talk about his experience with bipolar disorder and how he has overcome unique obstacles associated with it. If you are interested in joining the discussions, please email Serena Cho (scho1@exeter.edu) or me (akuwana@exeter.edu) to get on the email list.

The conservations will be facilitated by EASA board members, who have been trained by Jane Stapleton, the interim co-director of Student Well-being. Faculty will not be present at these discussions, but proctors present will take note of major conversation topics. Faculty and administration will discuss the notes taken after the conversations. This is intended \u201cto provide the adults on campus with an anonymous report of the way the students experience the boarding-school culture,\u201d according to senior Emily Robb, vice president of EASA. Dean of Students Arthur Cosgrove explained that the inter-dorm meetings are intended to spark \u201cconversations about social norms and behaviors on campus that can be improved to make our community more aware and safer.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cProctors are the liaison between students and faculty and the board and the students. You know the dorm best and we would appreciate any advice you have for us.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While the initiative was spearheaded by EASA along with the interim co-director of student well-being, Tina Sciocchetti and other deans, the proctors were included to aid the discussion and provide guidance. \u201cAs student leaders in the dormitories, proctor support and leadership will be helpful during these conversations,\u201d Cosgrove said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Dauge-Roth explained the importance of proctors in facilitating conversation and connecting the faculty and administration with students. \u201cProctors are the liaison between students and faculty and the board and the students. You know the dorm best and we would appreciate any advice you have for us,\u201d she said, in an email sent to all proctors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Details on the inter-dorm discussions are still being finalized. The exact population makeup of each meeting hasn\u2019t been decided yet. EASA is currently considering dividing lowerclassmen and upperclassmen, or hosting conversations with each grade separately. Small groups of day students may join dorm groups. Day student proctors would be expected to facilitate discussions similarly to dorm proctors in such a case.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Upper Pedro Sanson was worried that students would have trouble discussing a topic of such a sensitive nature. \u201cStudents may find it uncomfortable at first because this topic can be hard to talk about,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Robb addressed those fears, making clear that students who don\u2019t want to participate will not have to, and that resources will be available to students who are sensitized by the discussion. Dorm faculty, counselors and student listeners will be available throughout the meetings.

He felt that they would bring \u201cmany different voices and perspectives,\u201d to conversations around hookup culture and sexual misconduct.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Aivant Goyal, a proctor in Soule Hall, believed this was an important step forward. \u201c[The sexual climate] is one of those things that affects everyone equally but we can\u2019t really talk about it openly with the administration,\u201d he said. Goyal hopes that this will create more dialogue and normalize this issue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">EASA hopes to encourage more conversations around sexuality, and to mitigate any stigmas that surround those discussions. \u201cWe want students to be able to express the pressures they are feeling or not so that there is a greater understanding amongst students,\u201d Dauge-Roth said.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>\u201cWe want these conversations to help propagate a culture of respect for other students and target behaviors on our campus that can lead to assault.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Exonians Against Sexual Assault (EASA) club heads met with dorm and day student proctors last weekend to discuss a new joint initiative in which EASA will host inter-dorm conversations on sexual assault and the Academy\u2019s campus hookup culture. \u201cThese conversations are a place for students [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","date":"2016-10-13 18:54:04","modified":"2016-10-13 20:16:18","categories":[{"id":2,"slug":"news","title":"News","description":"","parent":0,"post_count":877}],"tags":[{"id":171,"slug":"2016-10-13","title":"2016-10-13","description":"","post_count":41}],"author":{"id":66,"slug":"ioyebode","name":"Inumidun Oyebode","first_name":"Inumidun","last_name":"Oyebode","nickname":"ioyebode","url":"","description":""},"comments":[],"attachments":[],"comment_count":0,"comment_status":"closed","custom_fields":{"authors":["Don Assamongkol, Jamie Cassidy, Erica Hogan"],"title-short":["EASA Proctor Meeting"],"photo_type":["horizontal"],"photo_caption":[""],"photo_credit":[""],"photo_alignment":[""],"web-editors":["Inumidun Oyebode"],"highlights":[""]}},{"id":16328,"type":"post","slug":"course-numbers-change-seniors-students-react","url":"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/2016\/10\/13\/course-numbers-change-seniors-students-react\/","status":"publish","title":"Course Numbers Change; Seniors, Students React","title_plain":"Course Numbers Change; Seniors, Students React","content":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This school year, Exeter\u2019s course catalog was published with updated course numbers, and many classes saw an uptick in their course number. According to Director of Studies Brooks Moriarty, the change was prompted because the inconsistency of the past course numbers across disciplines was creating confusion within and outside the Exeter community. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While many lamented the loss of infamous and well-known course numbers like History 333, the spring term U.S. history course, both the faculty and student body agreed, for the most part, that its change to History 430, along with a number of other changes, was necessary and helpful to the college admissions process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The changes also help to match systems used by other secondary schools and to establish a better understanding of course levels across different disciplines. The changes help to better reflect the difficulty of class workload and rigor when presented in Exeter\u2019s courses of instructions and college applications.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cI am sure people will get used to this new system and in a few years, nobody will be complaining.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Some students had noticed that Exeter\u2019s course numbers were lower compared to other boarding schools. Upper Brian Bae pointed out that the new system might cause some confusion among his peers, but he admitted that the update needed to come soon. \u201cI still think this is a positive change,\u201d Bae said, and that the \u201cdisorientation\u201d at numbering changes would quickly fade.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For current, returning members of the class of 2019 and 2018, all courses taken and labeled with their old numbers will be retroactively altered on their transcripts. Members of the class of 2017, however, will not have their transcripts changed. Instead, the College Counseling Office (CCO) will send transcripts along with a note explaining that course numbers have recently changed. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Director of College Counselling Betsy Dolan explained, \u201cThere will be information on the back of the transcript explaining course numbering changes, and Exeter\u2019s college profile will have verbiage as well.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Brian Choi was initially under the impression that course numbers on his transcript would be changed. \u201cPersonally, I think this helps students a lot. I don\u2019t believe the number change is going to make a huge difference, but I still think that it was a good idea for Exeter to increase some of the course numbers. Compared to some other schools, our courses are definitely just as hard or even more rigorous in some cases. It wouldn\u2019t make sense to have lower numbers.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When Choi found his transcript wasn\u2019t being updated, he expressed surprise. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding me. Now I\u2019m not really sure how I feel about this.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Most seniors seemed to be unaware of the situation. Senior Hilary Aristotle only found out recently. She was confused to why the changes weren\u2019t considered \u201crelevant\u201d to apply to seniors\u2019 transcripts. \u201cI\u2019m guessing that the courses are being changed so colleges can see Exonian transcripts and understand the course difficulty. If impressing colleges is the purpose of this change, why aren\u2019t they being applied to the students who need it now?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Kaitlyn Kang noticed that if course numbers don\u2019t change on senior transcripts, her courses could be seen as \u201csubpar\u201d compared to equivalent courses in the future. Expressing her fears, Kang remarked, \u201cThis change can cause an inaccurate representation of students\u2019 abilities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, while Kang found this change to be annoying, she felt quite differently on how it affected her class in particular. \u201cHonestly, I personally don\u2019t mind it,\u201d Kang said. \u201cA lot of other schools have boosted their course numbers, and Exeter has stayed up just until now. I don\u2019t think it will affect the way my transcript is seen by college, compared to peers in my class.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Yannick Yao agreed with Kang. He said he supports the new numbering system, regardless of how it affects his college application. \u201cI knew that the previous course numbers wouldn\u2019t change for seniors. Personally, I\u2019m fine with it,\u201d Yao explained. \u201cHonestly, I still need to take some basic courses this year to fulfill my graduation requirement, and the relatively higher course numbering makes my transcript look [better]. And for more advanced courses, a higher numbering gives the impression that a student took on more intellectual challenge.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Geyang Qin felt similarly. He argued that while the course numbers change, the actual material and studying is not affected. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t know the course number would be inconsistent,\u201d Qin admitted. \u201cI feel like they should keep the consistency, but it honestly doesn\u2019t bother me too much. I am sure people will get used to this new system and in a few years, nobody will be complaining.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Jesus Rivera, for example was aware that administration was not changing course numbers in senior transcripts. However, he expressed a more neutral position at the changes. \u201cIt\u2019s something that a lot of us have been talking about. They are worried that colleges are going to question the big gaps from last years courses to this years. The note from CCO will help, but I know people are worried not all colleges will take the effort to be super understanding.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Rivera also made a connection between this change and new forms of standardized testing. \u201cTo me it seems like the same stress that revolved around the new SAT. In the end, we can\u2019t really do anything about it, so I don\u2019t think we should stress.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>This school year, Exeter\u2019s course catalog was published with updated course numbers, and many classes saw an uptick in their course number.

The goal of the center is to help schools understand and improve their cultures through analyzing student-run, qualitative research.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The students conducting this year\u2019s research are lowers Shaan Bhandarkar, Anna Clark and Isadora Kron and uppers Jaynee Anaya, Menat Bahnasy, Ori Evans, Maria Heeter and Madison Stern. They plan to focus their research on a question about either gender neutral housing or how social class affects student lives and interactions on campus. This type of research, Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR), is aimed at community change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cThis isn\u2019t radical. It makes sense and aligns with our school\u2019s values that if we\u2019re going to study school culture and look at ways of improving it, that we actually have this formal mechanism that has students doing the work.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Last April, Director of Studies Brooks Moriarty, Dean of Academic Affairs Karen Lassey and Dean of Students Melissa Mischke attended the Round Table Conference in Philadelphia. This is an annual meeting where the student research teams from about 11 schools present their work and share what they were working on all year. They went to observe the conference and decide whether or not the program was something Exeter wanted to pursue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">According to Moriarty, they returned to campus excited by what they had seen. He was impressed by the level and quality of the work that the students had done as social science research. In addition, he saw that students acted as \u201cagents of change\u201d as their \u201cthorough and convincing research\u201d was received by peers, faculty and trustees. \u201cThe students were exploring exactly the kinds of questions schools should be asking in order to become better communities,\u201d Moriarty said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Another appealing facet of the program was that it allowed the school to view itself not only from the faculty or student perspective but to make informed decisions based on the research about different policies, practices and curriculum. \u201cI think to ground these ideas in rigorous research is really important and I\u2019m not sure we always do that, so this is just another way that adds that information to help our decisions,\u201d Lassey said. Moriarty agreed, saying, \u201cThis isn\u2019t radical. It makes sense and aligns with our school\u2019s values that if we\u2019re going to study school culture and look at ways of improving it, that we actually have this formal mechanism that has students doing the work.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As the School Coordinators, Lassey and Moriarty work closely with the group during their bi-weekly meetings. They also attended a retreat in September where they met Exeter\u2019s Research Assistant Joseph Nelson, a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania School of Education who has been working with the program for several years. Nelson\u2019s job is to help narrow down a research topic, guide the group on how to collect through data focus groups, surveys or interviews, then train the group in how to analyze and understand their findings. In the spring, he will help the students write a report from their observations to present at the Round Table Conference. This same presentation will be shown to the principal, students, faculty and trustees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">CSBGL offers the students instruction on qualitative research, similar to the curriculum level of an AP Social Science class. However, the club is currently an extra time commitment, so the students are working through the textbook in sections. In the coming years, the rigorous program may offer student researchers credit for their efforts and shift towards becoming an elective that offers one third of a credit each term. \u201cMaybe this could pave the way for opportunities in which students achieve credit for types of co-curricular activities on campus,\u201d Moriarty said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Since the goal of the research is to eventually follow through with steps to create change within the community, the coordinators opened the application to preps and lowers last spring. They thought it was important for students to have the time to continue the work. If the program continues next year, some of the returning researchers will work on policy changes, while another group will continue research and train a new set of lowers. \u201cWe have this idea of constant and connected experience for our students over time,\u201d Moriarty said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lassey agreed and said that last year there was a large pool of applicants to choose from. \u201cWe were excited about a lot of interest, and frankly, it was really hard to choose,\u201d she said. Students who were interested in taking their work \u201cto that next step\u201d by helping instigate change stood out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When asked about what drew her to CSBGL, Clark said she truly believes in Exeter\u2019s pedagogy and thought that CSBGL played very well to it. \u201cI think that it\u2019s our duty as current students to think about the future, and how to improve the school,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Kron echoed Clark\u2019s devotion to initiating positive changes on campus. \u201cI felt [the program] was a really good opportunity to make a significant change at the school in a topic that I am passionate about,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Stern reflected on how CSBGL introduced her to the concept of YPAR, admitting she didn\u2019t know \u201cthis whole world of qualitative research\u201d existed. She applied because of her interest in cultural anthropology, and thought it would be a more effective way of promoting change. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI watched last year how ineffective we really were at changing set things such as the [visitations] policy; we were going round and round with that and kind of just going off of observations, like, \u2018oh well maybe this is going on so therefore,\u2019 but you never really got anything concrete that you could [cite],\u201d Stern said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Bahnasy hoped her work with CSBGL will bring to light important issues on campus that are frequently overlooked. \u201cThere were definitely topics on campus that needed to be discussed, and some faculty and students shied away from,\u201d Bahnasy said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Heeter said that she wanted her work with CSBGL to make concrete changes instead of just clarifying issues on campus. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI think the Academy can improve its culture by first recognizing that there are problems and then by implementing policies that will address the problem instead of just saying \u2018there\u2019s a problem, students fix it,\u2019\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>This fall, eight students began research with the Center of the Study of Boys and Girls Lives (CSBGL), a program with the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education in which a select group of students chooses a topic about their school and spend a [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","date":"2016-10-13 18:49:15","modified":"2016-10-13 20:16:18","categories":[{"id":2,"slug":"news","title":"News","description":"","parent":0,"post_count":877}],"tags":[{"id":171,"slug":"2016-10-13","title":"2016-10-13","description":"","post_count":41}],"author":{"id":66,"slug":"ioyebode","name":"Inumidun Oyebode","first_name":"Inumidun","last_name":"Oyebode","nickname":"ioyebode","url":"","description":""},"comments":[],"attachments":[],"comment_count":0,"comment_status":"closed","custom_fields":{"authors":["Jackie Cho, Madison Kang, Arielle Lui"],"title-short":["Research with CSBGL"],"photo_type":["horizontal"],"photo_caption":[""],"photo_credit":[""],"photo_alignment":[""],"web-editors":["Inumidun Oyebode"],"highlights":[""]}},{"id":16293,"type":"post","slug":"boys-soccer-suffers-loss-to-new-hampton","url":"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/2016\/10\/13\/boys-soccer-suffers-loss-to-new-hampton\/","status":"publish","title":"Boy&#8217;s Soccer Suffers Loss To New Hampton","title_plain":"Boy&#8217;s Soccer Suffers Loss To New Hampton","content":"<p>Following a disappointing 0-1 loss to Brewster Academy last Wednesday, the boys\u2019 varsity soccer team lost again to the New Hampton School on Saturday, Oct. 8. The team\u2019s loss to New Hampton is especially disheartening given their history of success against the school; this marks their second loss in 25 years to New Hampton\u2019s team.<\/p>\n<p>Though the boys thought that they had learned from their game against Brewster not to underestimate a team based on its record, they were not prepared for the energy New Hampton brought to the field. And even though Exeter has demonstrated its dominance in past games against them, New Hampton had just come off of a big win and were eager for a second. \u201cWe expected them to have confidence following their first win of the season last week, but we weren\u2019t expecting them to come at us for the first 30 minutes with the energy that they did,\u201d upper Silas Lane explained.<\/p>\n<p>Upper Jack Baker also felt that Exeter had prepared itself for \u201ca gritty game,\u201d but that this was still not enough. \u201cFollowing a loss at Brewster, we hoped to bounce back and get a big win over New Hampton,\u201d he said. Instead, it ended up being \u201can unfortunate game.\u201d Though the team successfully possessed the ball and limited New Hampton\u2019s chances during the first half of the game, keeping the score to 0-0, their play began to fall apart in the second half. Their patience with the ball and lack of urgency to get it into the box proved detrimental, giving New Hampton opportunities to score. Due to an unforced give away and subsequent positioning errors, Exeter conceded a goal near the middle of the second half, but quickly responded with a skilled header goal by senior Ignacio Roitman. \u201cDespite this, we couldn\u2019t manage to get things moving,\u201d Baker said.<\/p>\n<p class=\"pullquote\">\u201cA lot of the time when someone makes a minor mistake, we make negative comments, which isn\u2019t productive for the player or the team as a whole.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Noting that there were gaps between the defense and the midfield and that the communication \u201cwasn\u2019t really there,\u201d Baker went on to say that the team even looked \u201cstatic\u201d on the field. According to him, the team had \u201ca collective breakdown,\u201d which resulted in another goal for New Hampton, further hurting Exeter\u2019s morale. The team made changes in its formation as a final attempt to come back against New Hampton, but ended up conceding a third goal. \u201cIn hindsight, if we had maintained our positioning and communicated better, we would have been able to prevent some really embarrassing goals,\u201d Baker said.<\/p>\n<p>Observing that Exeter had controlled the play for most of the game, senior Collin Shapiro echoed these regrets and said \u201cI thought we were the better team. Obviously it was tough to lose that game.\u201d Lane agreed, adding, \u201cWe had more quality on our team, as we also did against Brewster, but the energy and passion were missing once again.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Likewise, senior and captain Quintin DiStefano remarked, \u201cWe lost to a team that we could\u2019ve scored on lots of times.\u201d As Lane pointed, this gives Exeter two straight losses in one week against opposition that they \u201cshould be beating.\u201d However, he observed that the boys did have \u201cbright moments\u201d in their game against New Hampton, such as Roitman\u2019s goal and some of their best possession of the season so far.<\/p>\n<p>Senior and captain Tarek Khartabil also noted that Exeter \u201cdominated the play once again,\u201d but the team\u2019s inability to score led to its defeat. \u201cIf we can get that component together we could win a couple of games,\u201d he said. Shapiro, too, recognized that the team has struggled with finishing in the attacking third and \u201cfinding the back of the net,\u201d but added, \u201cif we can figure that out I think we will be a really tough team to play against.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>According to Baker, the boys also need to work on constructive communication. \u201cA lot of the time when someone makes a minor mistake, we make negative comments, which isn\u2019t productive for the player or the team as a whole,\u201d he explained. Maintaining shape in the midfield and in the back, while minimizing the gaps between the center backs and holding midfielders, will be crucial for the team. Going forward, DiStefano has prioritized fixing defensive mistakes and defending as a team.<\/p>\n<p>On a less technical note, Baker felt \u201cwe just need to want [to win] more.\u201d He explained, \u201cI think I speak for the team when I say that when things aren\u2019t going our way we tend to let it affect our mentality in a negative way.\u201d Baker suggested that by learning to channel their frustration and finding the desire to win games, the team will be successful. Lane remained confident that the team will continue to work on the quality of its play, as well as creating and finishing goal-scoring chances\u2014the two areas that let them down in both of their games in the last week. DiStefano emphasized that he has \u201cfaith the team will improve and bounce back from this past week.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Following a disappointing 0-1 loss to Brewster Academy last Wednesday, the boys\u2019 varsity soccer team lost again to the New Hampton School on Saturday, Oct. 8.

Soccer Ties Against Strong Milton Squad","title_plain":"Girls&#8217; Soccer Ties Against Strong Milton Squad","content":"<p>Girls\u2019 varsity soccer tied 0-0 with Milton Academy on Saturday, bringing Exeter\u2019s record to 2-5-1.<\/p>\n<p>Adjusting to several injuries and missing players, the team had changed its formation for the game against Milton. It had one playing up top, four players on defense, five in the center with two wings and three in the middle, forming a triangle. Three injuries had occurred during the preceding game: senior and co-captain Grace Pratt sprained her ankle, and uppers Anna Reaman and Lauren Arkell injured their legs.<\/p>\n<p>Senior Hannah Gustafson felt that the team adjusted well to the new positions and players. \u201cEveryone had to talk a lot more to make sure we stayed organized defensively and had good shape when moving the ball up the field,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>In practice, they have been working on dribbling the ball up the field instead of relying on passing. According to upper Louisa Bartkovich, this \u201chuge success\u201d has helped the team gain confidence with the ball. \u201cI think the team played really well given that we played with a formation or line up of people that have never played with each other yet,\u201d she said. She also thought the two teams were well-matched on Saturday.<\/p>\n<p>Upper Samantha Weaver agreed. \u201cWe were very evenly matched with Milton,\u201d she said. She added that they \u201cfought hard\u201d throughout the game, and despite the fact that they had several chances to score, \u201cthe ball just never made it into the net.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This difficulty scoring against Milton can be attributed to the team\u2019s emphasis on defense. Lower Ogechi Nwankwoala thinks Big Red can work on keeping \u201ca scoring mentality.\u201d She said that they tend to \u201csit back\u201d and prevent the other team from scoring, adding, \u201cwhich we do really well.\u201d However, the girls then don\u2019t have many attempts to score themselves because their focus is solely on defending. \u201cI think it was hard to score for us in our game [Saturday] because we didn\u2019t take many shots and the shots we took didn\u2019t go in,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p class=\"pullquote\">\u201cI think it was hard to score for us in our game [Saturday] because we didn\u2019t take many shots and the shots we took didn\u2019t go in.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Several players acknowledged that Big Red needs to work on its finishing, something it also struggled with last year. Senior and co-captain Daniela Nemirovsky said that this weakness made it challenging to score yesterday. \u201cWe had good chances, but couldn\u2019t capitalize on them,\u201d she said. However, she thought they adapted well to their new formation, using it to effectively play defense.<\/p>\n<p>Gustafson agreed saying, \u201cI think the biggest thing we need to improve upon in games is finishing.\u201d She explained that during some games they don\u2019t shoot enough, leading to their inability to score. \u201cWe need to also take better advantage of the opportunities we get and focus when trying to put it in the back of the net.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Throughout the season the girls have gotten closer in both their friendship and team dynamic. Nwankwoala said they know each other better than they did a month ago. \u201cWe know how each other plays and who plays well together and we\u2019ll just keep improving from here,\u201d she said. Postgraduate Kat Cucullo mirrored her sentiment saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve been connecting more throughout the season, so hopefully we will just continue to improve.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The team\u2019s next home game will be Thursday, Oct 13 at 4:45 p.m. against Pingree School.<\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Girls\u2019 varsity soccer tied 0-0 with Milton Academy on Saturday, bringing Exeter\u2019s record to 2-5-1.

reel, learned informal Russian greetings and experienced more at Exeter\u2019s first International Festival on Monday. It served as an opportunity for international students to proudly represent their countries and for other Exonians to learn about the home countries of their friends through food, games and informative posters. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Most international students were happy to have the chance to tell other students about their home country. Upper Dara Okerimi, who represented Nigeria, said that she had Nigerian food at her booth and that she showed students pictures of festivals and traditions that she thought represented Nigeria.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The International Student Alliance (ISA) decided to make fake \u201cpassports\u201d that students could bring to different booths to be stamped by various countries. This greatly encouraged students to visit as many booths as possible, and it made the experience interactive since students had to complete tasks in order to get their passport stamped.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">&#8220;Everyone was enjoying immersing themselves in foreign culture and learning about different countries.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Nicole Shi, a representative of Hong Kong, said that her booth incorporated games into their presentation. \u201cWe had fortune telling that incorporated the Chinese Zodiac,\u201d Shi said. \u201cWe also had a \u2018Chopstick Challenge\u2019 where people would use chopsticks to put as many candies\u2014White Rabbit, a local candy in Hong Kong\u2014in a bowl within 30 seconds.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To earn their Thailand stamp, students had to compete with Lower Dhanat Plewtianyingthawee in a game of Pao Kob, which consists of blowing rubber-bands across a table. Other countries like Mexico and Cambodia had lists of trivia questions compiled to test students\u2019 knowledge about the country\u2019s culture and history. After the festival, many students reported that they had a clearer sense of the different cultures infused together at Exeter.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Upper Nader Babar, who represented Pakistan, said that he remembered seeing students learn new things at the festival. \u201cEveryone was enjoying immersing themselves in foreign culture and learning about different countries, and I myself enjoyed it as well,\u201d Babar said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In addition to interactive games and activities at each booth, there was also a competition between countries for the best decorated exhibits. The winner was senior Anishta Khan, who manned the table for Bangladesh. Runner ups were upper Pedro Sanson, from Brazil, and Tricia Moriarty and Meg Bolan for Ireland. Each winner won 10 dollars in lion card money to spend at Grill or the bookstore. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Those who spent the afternoon bustling from table to table collecting every stamp could enter a raffle at the end to win a Fitbit Flex. The promise of a reward highly motivated attendees to step out of their comfort zones and try foods and candies that they had never even seen before. Particularly noteworthy was a Finnish candy that is vaguely referred to as \u201cthe Devil\u2019s Candy\u201d\u2014they are filled with salmiakki powder, and excessive ingestion will cause tongues to peel. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Students, faculty and their respective families thought the festival was a success.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Many were impressed with the diversity of countries present; almost all continents were represented. Upper Joaquin Riojas, who represented his home country of Mexico at the festival, thought that it helped Exonians appreciate the many different cultures that form the Exeter community. \u201cWith a student body coming from over 30 countries, I think it is important that we recognize the diversity of our community,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Students tasted plantain chips and suya spice, learned to fold paper cranes, tried to dance a celtic reel, learned informal Russian greetings and experienced more at Exeter\u2019s first International Festival on Monday.

Volleyball Edges Out Loomis","title_plain":"Girls&#8217; Volleyball Edges Out Loomis","content":"<p>The girls\u2019 varsity volleyball team competed at home against Loomis last Saturday. Coming off a big win over Pomfret, the team looked to continue its momentum. Exeter fought hard, and ultimately edged out Loomis in five sets, 3-2.<\/p>\n<p>Big Red knew that Loomis was going to be a strong team, having faced it in the championship last year; Exeter expected Loomis to come out hungry, hoping for revenge. Loomis had strong players positioned around the court: a good server, a strong outside hitter, etc. Senior and co-captain Rachel Luo pointed out, \u201cLoomis was a difficult team to play because they have some really strong players. For instance, in one set we got stuck in a rotation because one of their servers had a tough serve that we just couldn\u2019t seem to side out of.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Luo continued, describing the serving talent that made Loomis difficult to play against. \u201cAnother thing they do well is distribute their sets; they set the right sides and middles quite frequently,\u201d Luo said. Loomis also had a very high work rate, which was shown in their ability to fight back and take the fourth set.<\/p>\n<p>Everything started to click for Big Red last Saturday. Lower Sophie Faliero described this success. \u201cThis weekend I felt like the team really started playing, and the determination and strength that we\u2019ve been lacking since the beginning of the season showed,\u201d Faliero said. \u201cIn particular, we did a very good job with not getting down on ourselves and on our teammates when we began losing points and this allowed us to pull out a big win in the end.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"pullquote\">\u00a0\u201cThis weekend I felt like the team really started playing, and the determination and strength that we\u2019ve been lacking since the beginning of the season showed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Upper Margaret Kraus echoed Faliero. \u201cWinning is the most satisfying when you know your teammates put everything into the game, and that was definitely the case on Saturday. We were all so proud of each other,\u201d Kraus explained.<\/p>\n<p>Upper Chloe Scocimara did a great job in the middle front, putting the ball away when the team needed her too. Kat Dumoulin and Sophie Faliero were very successful in returning serves, which, in Luo\u2019s opinion, was \u201cone of the biggest differences between the Loomis game and some of our past games.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Exeter looks to carry their momentum from the Loomis game into their game on Saturday against NMH. \u201cAnother hugely important lesson Loomis taught us is that we have to start strong and finish strong. We lost that first set and we made a recovery, but that fourth set definitely humbled us and refocused us for the fifth,\u201d Luo said, reflecting on the game. If the team is able to start and finish well, they will find success against NMH.<\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>The girls\u2019 varsity volleyball team competed at home against Loomis last Saturday.

Xiang","title_plain":"Evan Xiang","content":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Scholar, leader, athlete. Senior Evan Xiang juggles it all, managing to balance her roles as co-Editor-in-Chief of the yearbook (PEAN), member of the Exeter squash team, co-head of the competitive Chess Club and Children\u2019s Coordinator for the Exeter Social Service Organization (ESSO). <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Xiang\u2019s ability to balance these roles with ease is rooted in her love for what she does\u2014whether it\u2019s teaching local children how to play chess, editing the layout of PEAN on a Friday night or traveling to matches with the squash team in the winter. \u201cI always find myself challenging myself to do more,\u201d she explained. Even when her many commitments can, at times, feel stressful in the face of school work and college applications, Xiang emphasized that her enjoyment in what she does makes it worthwhile. \u201cYou need to enjoy the things you do or else it will just feel like meaningless work,\u201d she said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Of her many interests, chess has proven the most \u201cmeaningful and valuable.\u201d Since she first started playing in kindergarten, Xiang has nurtured a passion for the game, but her school never offered a club in which she could formally play and compete with others who shared her interest. This changed when she arrived at Exeter; following in the footsteps of her older sister Ellen \u201915, who had helped to restart Chess Club several years earlier, the younger Xiang joined because she \u201cthought it would be cool to play with people who also loved chess.\u201d Soon, she was attending the Saturday-night meetings on a regular basis and, as she grew closer with the other members, came to discover a sense of community within the club.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">&#8220;I sense younger students see her as the reliable older sister, the one who is busy with her own pursuits but always there when they need her, for anything.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWalking into the music building on Saturday nights and seeing people already playing games, or walking into Grill during the week and seeing people just sitting there playing chess &#8230; there\u2019s this great feeling of community among all of us [Chess Club members],\u201d Xiang mused. Since joining, Xiang has become co-head and helped bring the club to the high school nationals, where they placed seventh the first year and sixth the second year. \u201cCompared to previous years when we didn\u2019t go to any tournaments, this is really great and I hope we can continue our strong standing,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For senior Richard Chen, Xiang\u2019s warm and inviting presence in Chess Club helped him adjust to Exeter as a new lower. \u201cAs a co-head of Chess Club, she not only tries to encourage old players to get better, she welcomes new players,\u201d he explained. Chen praised her ability to teach game strategies and help members improve their skills, while \u201ctaking the time to get to know and help everyone.\u201d He described her as \u201cbubbly,\u201d but also \u201cserious when she needs to be.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Xiang\u2019s willingness to offer her help to others and lead by example extends to her role in ESSO as well. Inspired by the work she did teaching refugee children how to play chess back in middle school, Xiang joined ESSO Chess as a way to \u201cget out of the Exeter bubble\u201d and share her knowledge with local kids. According to Community Service Coordinator Elizabeth Reyes, Xiang \u201ctakes her responsibilities seriously and truly cares about the community children she dedicates her time and energy to help.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Xiang, who began as an ESSO children\u2019s club co-head and was appointed to the ESSO Board as a Children\u2019s Coordinator last year, helps keep the ESSO Board on task and offers her organizational skills to better set up systems to run the clubs and program, according to Reyes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cShe follows through on tasks assigned and knows to ask questions if clarification is needed,\u201d Reyes said. She went on to describe Xiang as \u201ca conscientious caring student who does not shy away from her role as a Coordinator.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Meghan Chou, a close friend of Xiang\u2019s, echoed this praise, and added that Xiang is both determined and reliable. \u201cShe is able to think with a very clear head in tight situations,\u201d Chou explained, \u201cand she thinks ahead, plans well. She uses her chess skills in real life.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For Xiang, playing chess certainly has taught her skills that have carried over to the way she leads her life. Observing the many life lessons she has learned from the game, Xiang listed \u201cthinking on your feet\u201d and \u201chaving plans but being able to adjust yourself based on how your opponent reacts.\u201d She went on, saying \u201cin life, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s actually going to happen, you can plan all you want but life will always do something to it and you need to be able to get back up, adjust yourself and continue.\u201d Similarly, \u201cyou don\u2019t give up in chess,\u201d Xiang explained. \u201cYou always keep going.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Xiang also found these philosophies to hold true in squash. \u201cYou have to plan where you\u2019re going to put the ball and that makes me think of how you plan out your moves in chess,\u201d she explained. Though Xiang had played tennis prior to coming to Exeter, she found squash a better alternative \u201cbecause [she] didn\u2019t have to play outside.\u201d Since joining the team as a prep, she has grown to love the physical components of the sport. \u201cYou have to be fast, you have to be strong, your strokes need to be good,\u201d she said. However, she felt that both squash and tennis \u201ccarry the same mentality.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lower Chandler Jean-Jacques described Xiang as a positive and encouraging member of the squash team. \u201cDuring practice, she made all of us new kids feel welcome on the team and I really appreciated that,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Similarly, Xiang\u2019s adviser and English instructor Patricia Burke-Hickey, described Xiang as \u201ca loyal, trustworthy friend to students in the dorm.\u201d She went on to say \u201cI sense younger students see her as the reliable older sister, the one who is busy with her own pursuits but always there when they need her, for anything.\u201d According to Burke-Hickey, Xiang\u2019s smile says it all: Her kindness is genuine.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Scholar, leader, athlete.

Marshall had been teaching Trethewey\u2019s poetry at UNH and was very excited to see her in person. A highlight for Marshall upon her visit four years ago was the student body&#8217;s enthusiasm. Marshall was impressed by the extensive line of Exonians waiting to buy books and get them signed after Trethewey\u2019s reading. \u201cIt was like a concert! That was really exciting. I said, \u2018Wow, look at everybody going up for poetry!\u2019\u201d Marshall said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Marshall has been teaching English for 15 years with a B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. in English. Marshall is certainly not new to the English scene, having sat in many classrooms over the course of her career. However, Marshall claims that sitting with so many \u201cyoung, brilliant minds\u201d around the Harkness table has reminded her of why she became an English major back in college. In traditional classrooms Marshall held the role of providing cultural context along with framing questions for the literature studied in her courses. With Harkness, Marshall now has the liberty of hearing what new readers have to say about the text.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">&#8220;She is a joy-bringer. I am in her adult Zumba group and she is always smiling and happy, and I see that spirit in her teaching as well. I hear a lot of laughter coming from her classroom!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Marshall said that she loves her time so far at Exeter. \u201cEverybody wants to be helpful and friendly. My students are great for getting me up to speed on Exeter lingo and traditions, and I\u2019m grateful for that. I\u2019m blown away by how much everyone cares for one another,\u201d Marshall said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Chair of the English department Ellen Wolff expressed how fortunate the faculty feel to have Marshall working with them. \u201cShe brings deep expertise in an array of authors and texts, a contagious curiosity, a joyful dedication to her students and our community and an upbeat and imaginative approach to all she does,\u201d Wolff said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">English instructor Jane Cadwell agreed with Wolff. She said, \u201cWe are fortunate to have such an experienced and devoted teacher join our ranks &#8230; She brings an awesome energy; I have found her to be a positive and joyful presence in and out of Phillips Hall,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">English instructor Alex Meyers said that Marshall brings a \u201creal richness\u201d to Exeter, as she has had varying teaching experiences. \u201cShe has the perspective of what it is like in higher education and that can inform how she works with students here,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Aivant Goyal, a student in her class, described Marshall as very bubbly and positive. \u201cShe\u2019s different in the upbeat way she approaches everything she does, making the environment in the classroom really happy,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Although very new to the Exeter community, Marshall has already expanded her horizons around campus, taking on the adviser role for the Cooking Club as well as teaching Zumba for Be Well Exeter. Marshall cares a lot about body positivity and working with people on developing a healthy body image. She hopes to possibly pursue that work at some point during her time here. When she\u2019s not teaching English, Marshall works as a certified personal trainer and group exercise instructor. Marshall will be teaching Introduction to Fitness in the spring and has already been asked to do a Zumba event for a dorm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">English instructor Kelly Flynn said, \u201cShe is a joy-bringer. I am in her adult Zumba group and she is always smiling and happy, and I see that spirit in her teaching as well. I hear a lot of laughter coming from her classroom!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lower Bella Alvarez described how Marshall seemed to genuinely care about each student. \u201cShe\u2019s a very personable teacher, and always asks for our input about how to improve class or how we might want to do something differently.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">English instructor Christina Breen noted that Marshall\u2019s personality really draws people in as she is humble and engaging at the same time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI really have enjoyed getting to know her, not simply for her wealth of knowledge about English Lit, but for her passion for Zumba, for prison reform, for pop culture and for her genuine love of knowing people\u2019s stories,\u201d Breen said. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>If you ever hear music playing on the walkway around campus, it\u2019s likely coming from the book bag of Courtney Marshall, a new English instructor at the Academy.

It\u2019s travelling at such a high speed that an average goalie would fail to stop it in time. However, senior Max Gross leaps into the air, cupping the spinning ball in his hands and defending the goal a split second before it reaches the net. He scans the vast field for an open teammate. Gross aims and kicks, and the ball arcs through the sky and lands into the possession of senior Quintin DiStefano. DiStefano dodges helpless defenders and passes the ball to senior Tarek Khartabil, who kicks the ball heartily, rocketing it into the net. The crowd goes wild\u2014the trio have done it again.<\/p>\n<p>As co-captains of the boys\u2019 varsity soccer team, Gross, DiStefano and Khartabil take on the large responsibility of carrying the boys through all 20 of their games this season.<\/p>\n<p>Gross is a Division I recruit goalie, known for the passion and energy he brings to every practice and game. He strives to be the supporting backbone of the team, motivating his teammates during practice.<\/p>\n<p>Senior Alistair Matule commented on Gross\u2019s optimistic attitude. \u201cWhether it be pre-game or half-time, Max always has the right mentality and mindset,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Gross\u2019s dedication to the sport was evident in his goals heading into his final season at the Academy. \u201cI want to be there as much as I can, giving it my all in my last year here,\u201d Gross said.<\/p>\n<p class=\"pullquote\">\u201cLast year, in the dining hall, Max and Quintin both came up and they expressed their readiness for the game even in the dining hall during lunch the day of the game. They both showed they were excited and hyped up to play in the game and to do the best they could.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>DiStefano, a left midfielder, shares a similar mentality to Gross, using his drive to win to fuel the team during the game.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cQuintin is one of those players who gives their 110 percent every minute of the game. I definitely respect him for that,\u201d Matule said.<\/p>\n<p>Along with their ability to focus on the game, the captains also maintain a laidback atmosphere, keeping it lighthearted. Prep Jamie Lowell praised the captains\u2019 ability to remain flexible in different situations. \u201cAll the captains joke around but they get serious when they need everyone to focus,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Gross has been playing soccer all of his life. Going out on a limb, Gross tried the position of goalie, sticking to that position from that day on. He began to seriously partake in the game at the age of 12, enjoying the competitive drive. Gross came to Exeter as a new lower and has played on varsity all three years. Coming from an environment where he practiced the sport year-round, Exeter was a big change.<\/p>\n<p>Of all the positive things to be said about the team, Gross emphasized the unity among team members. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see our preps and lowers becoming good friends with the seniors and postgraduates. One example can be seen in the budding bromance between prep Jamie Lowell and [postgraduate] Ignacio (Nacho) [Roitman],\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>DiStefano, like Gross, began playing soccer in his early years, starting at the age of four. He has always looked up to his older brother, who was his biggest influence in soccer. Some of his earliest memories of the sport came from spectating at his brother\u2019s soccer games. Quintin came to Exeter as a prep and has played on the team all four years.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThirteen years of soccer, and I\u2019m still in love with the game,\u201d DiStefano said.<\/p>\n<p>DiStefano and Gross are the backbone of the team, both known to be enthusiastic leaders and bringing laughter and motivation to every one of their teammates.<\/p>\n<p>Matule praised their dedication and ambition, saying, \u201cBoth of them have shown their competitive drive and their desire to win and to make it to the next level in the very competitive league that we play in.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Matule recalled a distinct memory of Gross and DiStefano\u2019s spirit before a highly anticipated game against Northfield Mount Hermon. \u201cLast year, in the dining hall, Max and Quintin both came up and they expressed their readiness for the game even in the dining hall during lunch the day of the game. They both showed they were excited and hyped up to play in the game and to do the best they could.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Gross and DiStefano are both inspiring leaders and are role models for their team both on and off the soccer field. As the two reflect on their experiences at the Academy, it is apparent how much the soccer team has influenced their lives here.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cExeter soccer has been and continues to be one of the most valuable experiences of my time at PEA. I have learned so much about competing and motivation from playing for this team,\u201d DiStefano said.<\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Heading towards the goal, the ball flies through the air at 70 miles per hour.

and Wetherell Dining Halls are busy preparing for the day before most students even get out of bed. They clean dishes, cook meals and work long hours to serve the faculty, staff and students of Exeter. In order to create a more efficient and technology-based environment, the dining hall staff now check in using biometrics authentication, a fingerprint system. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Chief Financial Officer David Hanson explained that the system is not a security system, but rather a method of clocking in and out during shifts. According to Hanson, under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the school must \u201cproperly account for all hours worked by any staff member who is paid on an hourly basis\u201d in order to pay employees accordingly. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">According to Hanson, the system is a federally required updated version of \u201cinefficient and outdated\u201d forms such as reporting on paper. Dining hall staff go through a two-step process to sign in\u2014a proximity badge identifies the employee and the biometrics prevents staff from \u201cbuddy punching.\u201d Facilities Management also included biometrics as part of their employee check-in process. \u201cUsing biometrics is not a change for dining services as we are keeping in line with their current system,\u201d Hanson said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cSome students are super friendly and nice. Others are just quiet. Everybody is always polite. Everyone is genuinely sweet, pleasant and nice.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Wetherell dining staff member Nicky Jackson explained that hand washing prompts issues with the fingerprint scanner. The staff wash their hands frequently throughout the day and sometimes the scanner cannot identify her fingerprint. \u201cIt\u2019s just like with your phone,\u201d Jackson said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The staff will receive more training on the system in the coming weeks. Wetherell dining staff member Salina Kolias explained that the staff is expecting an addition to the fingerprint scan, but they do not know exactly what that entails. She expressed the same<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>frustration with the scanner as Jackson. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt is definitely a pain in the butt \u2026 especially when you\u2019re working\u2014you can see my fingers are all pruny from the water, so it\u2019s definitely tough to clock out,\u201d she said.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 \u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While there are challenges to working in the dining halls and the new check-in system, workers interviewed by <i>The Exonian<\/i> felt that the positive working atmosphere made up for any difficulties.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Manager of Wetherell Dining Hall Heidi Brousseau noted the difficulties caused by Wetherell\u2019s understaffed state. According to Brousseau, the Academy doesn\u2019t outsource dining hall staffing or operations, and instead hires in-house through the department of Human Resources. When the department is short on workers, they are forced to find temporary workers to cover shifts. \u201cIt\u2019s not always reliable, but we work with what we\u2019ve got,\u201d said Brousseau of the system.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Brousseau also highlighted the growth opportunities and resources afforded by the Academy to the food service workers. \u201cOne of the things that I\u2019ve liked about this job is that I\u2019ve gotten a lot of career development. I started at the front of the house putting food on the line and now I\u2019m overseeing everything. In that time I\u2019ve gotten training and development,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Jackson, who is temporarily working in the dining halls having been transferred from the catering department, emphasized the harshness of the labor itself. \u201cIt\u2019s very fast paced \u2026 It is really grueling work \u2026 I\u2019m glad it\u2019s temporary for me because it\u2019s very hard,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Despite this, she finds joy in her work. \u201cThe working conditions there I\u2019d say are very positive and happy,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Kolias also noted difficulties in her day to day work, but felt that her coworkers were a highlight. \u201c[Working in the dish room is] definitely sticky and dirty but the people make it better, so it\u2019s not that bad,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Both highlighted interactions with students as a positive point of their work. \u201cA lot of [students] actually will stop by and say hi and what not. It kind of makes our day,\u201d said Kolias.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Jackson echoed that sentiment, saying \u201cSome [students] are super friendly and nice. Others are just quiet. Everybody is always polite. Everyone is genuinely sweet, pleasant and nice.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Every morning, the staff of Elm and Wetherell Dining Halls are busy preparing for the day before most students even get out of bed.

Looking for a new place to get your burger fix? Tired of spending money on expensive food? Look no further. Lexi\u2019s Peace-Love-Burger has just opened up a location in Exeter: the Test Kitchen.<\/p>\n<p>Nestled in front of the Amtrak Station and adjacent to Gerry\u2019s Variety Store, the remodeled building looks completely different from the former Good Karma Caf\u00e9. The first story of the building appears larger with the cash register pushed into a cavity on the left wall. Customers wait at the front for a friendly host and can choose either the outdoor patio or the indoor seating. The wood-panel walls have been painted red, orange, and white with pop of teal. The red chairs and the wooden tables match the walls. The mid century lighting fixtures expose draped crimson cords and fancy filament bulbs. The modern restaurant design is a refreshing change from the hippy-esque, eco-friendly Good Karma Caf\u00e9.<\/p>\n<p>The menu offers a wide variety of burgers, fries, milkshakes and sandwiches. Their specialty is beef burgers, but they also offer a housemade \u201cBeanie Burger\u201d for vegetarians like myself. Their \u201cGreen Lantern\u201d burger, which comes with avocado, cheddar cheese, tomatoes and chimichurri, is my personal favorite\u2014the different flavors melt into a mouthwatering concoction. For a salty and crunchy side, I ordered their plain fries.<\/p>\n<p>For meat eaters, I\u2019d suggest the \u201cHighway Man\u201d burger, which comes with ham, bacon, a fried egg, American cheese, crispy onions and BBQ sauce. Customers are also allowed to build their own burger from a list of about 20 ingredients. Lexi\u2019s other specialty is their famous milkshakes. Each has their own scrumptious presentation. A couple of standouts include the \u201cChocolate,\u201d which features dark chocolate dripping down the sides of cup, and the \u201cDeath by Chocolate,\u201d which sports a Hostess Cupcake floating in a storm of whipped cream. The Test Kitchen also features daily specials on their Facebook page, which always include two milkshakes and a burger.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of pricing, Lexi\u2019s is extremely affordable on a student\u2019s budget. Most of their burgers are less than six dollars and their fries are only a dollar and 50 cents \u2014 a huge change from Good Karma\u2019s 12-dollar burgers and six-dollar fries. If you don\u2019t want to spend big bucks at Green Bean, Lexi\u2019s also has a grilled cheese sandwich for only three dollars. Their milkshakes may be a less healthy alternative to Laney and Lu\u2019s 10-dollar smoothies, but they are less than half the price. You\u2019ll walk out of The Test Kitchen with a bigger stomach and a bigger wallet too!<\/p>\n<p>I only have a few complaints about this new restaurant. The first is that their service can be slow. When they are packed, they tend to take a while to even take your order. It is definitely not a fast food restaurant. In addition to this, the indoor seating is very limited since they eliminated the upstairs component that Good Karma Caf\u00e9 utilized. Once winter hits and the outdoor seating is closed, it will be difficult to comfortably fit a large group of friends in the loud space. I also think if they began to deliver, their profits would drastically increase. However, the quality of food is very good considering the low prices, and the environment is both kid and teen friendly.

Yes, some people may be stay up until 3 and bust out three papers and a test the next day, but it shouldn\u2019t be a race because it isn\u2019t a level playing field.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Upper Nick Song also pointed out that poor time management is what leads to the accumulation of Red Bulls in recycling bins. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible to get a normal amount of sleep each night if you plan ahead accordingly. We get trapped in this mindset that you\u2019re \u2018doing Exeter wrong\u2019 if you\u2019re not staying up until the sun rises doing homework. It\u2019s a terrible excuse.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Song continued. \u201cWe\u2019re tied to extra-curriculars, yet no one made us sign up for them in the first place! Plan ahead, use your frees and learn to say no to some of the stuff Exeter offers you if you can\u2019t manage everything at once. Exeter trusts us to utilize and manage our time well.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, it\u2019s not as though Exeter hasn\u2019t established support systems for students. \u201cOur whole school is built for us to succeed,\u201d Song continued. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI haven\u2019t heard of one teacher who hasn\u2019t offered to meet after classes for extra help.

Next summer will be the second year the department offers stipends for the internships, which range from three to six weeks and are open to rising seniors.<\/p>\n<p>Each student who is chosen to participate in the internships will work on a history project that will then be presented to the broader public. What history instructor Betty Luther-Hillman called \u201cpublic history\u201d is a type of historical work, separate from schools and universities, that works inside museums, public policy organizations, historical societies or in social media.<\/p>\n<p class=\"pullquote\">\u201cIn order to engage the public with historical knowledge, I aimed my research beyond the specialized academia I was used to in the school setting.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Luther-Hillman said the internships offer valuable opportunities that wouldn\u2019t be available without alumni donations for stipends and connections set up with organizations. \u201cFor both the financial funding and for providing those contacts to create those opportunities it was really wonderful,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>The application process, which according to Luther-Hillman should take place in the winter, will include a written application as well as an interview with the respective organization. Last year, Project Manager of the The Center for Science and Society Naomi Rosenkranz interviewed and selected senior Christine Hu as the inaugural intern. Vice President, Director of the Center for Women\u2019s History and Chief Historian of the New York Historical Society Valerie Paley selected senior Sally Ma. Luther-Hillman said there were several applicants for each internship and anticipates the same outpour of interest from the class of 2018.<\/p>\n<p>Paley said the projects for internships next summer will include exhibition research, K-12 curriculum design and consultation, brainstorming public programs and many other administrative tasks. While the New York Historical Society has already offered internships for high school and college students for several years, last summer was the first time they placed a high school student within the college intern program. \u201cSally Ma was a stellar inaugural Exeter intern,\u201d Paley said.<\/p>\n<p>Paley believes the internship is useful for any student of history to learn how they can apply their knowledge in the workplace or in a museum setting. \u201cIt can be challenging to articulate complex ideas in an accessible way for all levels of museum visitors and is a skill that is worth learning early, no matter what career path a student ultimately chooses,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>According to Director of Center for Science and Society Pamela Smith, there will be two projects next summer, the Making and Knowing Project in May at Columbia and a Translation and Encoding Workshop in June in France. \u201cChristine\u2019s internship allowed us to share our knowledge with her, and her skills and new perspective were an enriching contribution to our work,\u201d Smith said.<\/p>\n<p>Ma said her six-week internship at the New York Historical Society transformed her perspective on history. Her first task was to research New York women under the age of 35. At the time, the Center for Women\u2019s History was working on a project called \u201cWomen\u2019s Voices,\u201d writing biographical profiles woven with historical primary sources. \u201c[Paley\u2019s] assignment completely baffled me because I never registered contemporary women as part of history,\u201d Ma said. \u201cAfter all, shouldn\u2019t history be things at least a decade ago?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As she investigated further, she realized knowledge about young, living women helped guide her through a different facet of the feminist history\u2014one that was not entirely comprised of white, middle-class, heterosexual women. As the only Asian on the women\u2019s history team at the center, Ma dedicated herself to the voices of Asian American women, such as Joo-Hyun Kang, a Korean American activist advocating for NYPD police reform and rights of queer people of color and Sarinya Srisakul, a Thai first-generation New York firefighter. \u201cI was intrigued by the eloquence and bravery of women with diverse identities and backgrounds,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>Ma feels that she has gained valuable archival and material research skills. She admitted that before last summer most of her research had been solely text-based for papers. An exhibition required substantial visual components, which she \u201chad no clue how to obtain\u201d prior to her internship experience. Luckily, the women\u2019s history team happily offered helpful pointers. Ma was initially intimidated by this college-aged group. However, her confidence gradually grew as her research skills improved.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHoning my archival and material research skills, I marveled at the art of public history,\u201d Ma said. \u201cIn order to engage the public with historical knowledge, I aimed my research beyond the specialized academia I was used to in the school setting.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At the Center for Science and Society, Hu also engaged with history in a form beyond the classroom. During her internship, Hu worked on a project with about two dozen graduate students from several different universities. The goal of the project was to transcribe, translate and digitize a medieval manuscript. Since it was written in old French, the group collaborated with French scholars and students from a French university. Most of Hu\u2019s day was spent doing managerial tasks such as taking photos and uploading them to the group\u2019s Flickr, updating their website and ordering food for meetings. She also helped edit and research annotations that were found throughout the manuscript.<\/p>\n<p>When Hu read the description of the internship she thought it sounded like a great opportunity. \u201cI\u2019m someone who has trouble choosing between subjects when it comes to deciding what I want to do when I get older,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was nice to see something that seemed to combine a lot of different subjects.\u201d Even though the project was history-based, she noted that her work also involved computer science with the digitization of the manuscript.<\/p>\n<p>Just like Ma, Hu was the only high school student in the group and found it \u201ckind of intimidating\u201d to be surrounded by established scholars. However, many of them took her \u201cunder their wing\u201d and were helpful and friendly, providing an overall enlightening summer experience. \u201cThey were really nice, and I got a lot of insight as to what it was like to study history at that level,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>The history department offered two new internships last summer, one at the New York Historical Society and one at the Center for Science and Society at Columbia University.

Through subtle humor and interactive questions, Thurber discussed the reasons why young adults take impulsive risks, and how Exonians should safely think about and learn to avoid those risks.<\/p>\n<p class=\"pullquote\">\u00a0\u201cDr. Thurber brought up a good point about how our society judges us teenagers too quickly by the fact that our frontal lobes aren\u2019t fully developed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Thurber outlined some examples of impulsive risk-taking and encouraged students to explain why people took those risks. Students identified \u201cpeer-pressure,\u201d \u201ccuriosity\u201d and \u201cexcitement in the spur-of-the-moment\u201d as some factors that contribute to impulsive and risky behavior. However, Thurber stressed that while many are made impulsively, not all risky decisions are bad. Using examples of the inventions and work of Marie Curie and Alfred Nobel, he explained that people can learn a great deal through their mistakes. \u201cWe can\u2019t stop taking risks, but we have to think more about those risks,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Thurber said that Exeter students, as adolescents, are naturally inclined to take risks.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually a good thing that adolescents take risks,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what makes you intellectually curious.\u201d He emphasized that adolescent risk-taking is a valuable way to prepare for life as an adult, but he cautioned against taking risks that could end up hurting oneself or others.<\/p>\n<p>Thurber introduced the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) as a way that the school can determine whether students are taking healthy or dangerous risks. The survey, which was administered to students last year and will be again this year, assesses six types of risky behaviors, including sexual activity, eating disorders and alcohol, drug and tobacco use, which are leading causes of death and disability among young adults. Thurber said that Exeter\u2019s health department will inform students later this year of ways that the school can address any dangerous-risk areas of the survey where Exeter students, as a whole, show weakness.<\/p>\n<p>Thurber also introduced the two new interim directors of student well-being: Tina Sciocchetti and Jane Stapleton, who work with the department of Counseling and Psychological Services as a part of their on-campus work.<\/p>\n<p>The directors will \u201caddress sexual misconduct, assault, harassment and other misbehavior on campus\u201d and \u201cpush bystanders to take action against misbehavior for a respectful environment,\u201d Thurber said. Sciocchetti will work to improve policies and procedures related to sexual assault and misconduct, while Stapleton will work to educate students about sexual assault.<\/p>\n<p>Students thought the speech was effective in inspiring Exonians to take more healthy risks. \u201cI think this speech will encourage people to take smart risks, like auditioning for groups, or trying out for sports that they\u2019ve never played before,\u201d lower Michaela Phan said. Some thought that the speech could even apply to speaking up at the Harkness table.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe speech had a universal application,\u201d lower Yaseen Ahmed said. \u201cIt relates to Harkness \u2026 not being afraid to take a risk and say something that might sound stupid, because it could actually add to the conversation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Most thought the speech was especially relevant to high-achieving Exeter students.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone at Exeter is put under a lot of pressure to be the best,\u201d prep Sam Weil said. \u201cI think the speech\u2019s idea of a growth mindset and that making mistakes is normal could be helpful in relieving that pressure.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Phan agreed with Weil. \u201cA lot of people here feel the pressure to \u2018not make mistakes\u2019 because when they come to Exeter, they\u2019re good at things,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re afraid of making mistakes and being wrong, but it\u2019s ok to make mistakes. The message was: Don\u2019t be embarrassed of your mistakes, just learn from them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Some students were already familiar with the idea of careful risk-taking that Thurber presented.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI myself am already a risk-taker, I feel, coming to a boarding school,\u201d prep Johan Martinez said. \u201cSo, I definitely feel like [the speech] was relatable, and it made sense to me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Some students drew parallels between Thurber\u2019s speech and the recent discussions about sexual assault on campus in their reaction to the assembly. Upper Anzi DeBenedetto said, \u201cIn our current situation at Exeter, with all the talk of sexual misconduct, thinking before acting is pretty important risk management.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Upper Molly Canfield also thought that Thurber\u2019s assembly was pertinent to Exeter\u2019s ongoing dialogue about sexual climate. \u201cI thought that [the speech] was really interesting, especially with all of the discussions that have been going on about sexual assault on campus &#8230; in many ways this just kind of ties into that,\u201d Canfield said.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, DeBenedetto thought Thurber\u2019s speech would strengthen discussion of healthy risk-taking between teens and adults.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDr. Thurber brought up a good point about how our society judges us teenagers too quickly by the fact that our frontal lobes aren\u2019t fully developed,\u201d DeBenedetto said. \u201cThat quick judgement gets in the way of teen-to-adult conversations, which are often defensive, rather than accepting.

Cilley Hall instituted a rule requiring students to wear shorts outside their personal dorm rooms, especially when students walk to the showers as opposed to allowing students to simply wrap a towel around their waist.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Other dorms, such as McConnell and Merrill, have held meetings addressing the amount of clothing that dorm faculty feel is appropriate when in common spaces.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Dean of Residential Life AJ Cosgrove said that rules requiring students to wear a certain amount of clothing in public spaces are in place to make those who use those spaces comfortable. \u201cThe idea is to be cognizant and respectful of everyone who lives and works in the dormitories,\u201d he said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Cilley Hall\u2019s dorm head, physical education instructor Melissa Pacific, introduced Cilley\u2019s new policy at a dorm meeting the first week of school, according to senior Charlie Dubiel. He said she referenced concerns that a student\u2019s towel may slip, resulting in a faculty member seeing him<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>naked and being placed in a very awkward sitution, especially if the student is underage. She also explained the policy as a way to help students and faculty feel more comfortable while in the dorm or while inviting students from other dorms to visit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cIt makes sense, especially in all the drama that\u2019s happening with all the boarding schools. It acts as an extra layer of protection to make sure nothing bad happens.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Pacific declined to comment for the article, and other Cilley dorm faculty either referred to her or did not respond. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The new rules in Cilley were met with frustration as students complained they were strict and unnecessary. Upper Taylor Walshe called the new measure \u201cextreme,\u201d particularly in the case of the requirement to wear shorts when walking to the showers, which are located on each floor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Jiro Mizuno agreed with Walshe, citing the rule\u2019s uncomfortability as its biggest setback. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cGoing to the shower with [shorts] adds a whole new dynamic for going to the showers. It\u2019s uncomfortable, it feels forced, it\u2019s very clumsy to start stripping in the showers, hanging your gym shorts on the rack for towels, showering and wearing wet shorts that were sprayed by the showers back to my room,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Mizuno also felt that wearing shorts took part of the relaxation away from the shower process. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201c[S]howers should be about being able to strip in the comfort of your room\u2014wrapping a towel [around your waist] in anticipation of the hot water that will cleanse your body\u2014walk into a showering stall and simply release your towel, enjoying the hot water,\u201d he said. \u201cThen you should be able to dry yourself and use the towel once more to quickly return to your room.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Similarly, Dubiel described the new policy as an \u201cunnecessary hassle,\u201d regardless of the reasons for instituting the policy. \u201cI rarely, if ever, encounter faculty in the hallways while going to shower. Even if we did often bump into faculty in the hallway, I believe that wearing shorts should be at each student\u2019s discretion, as has been the case since my prep year,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Upper Pedro Sanson said that while transitioning into the new rule was difficult at the start, particularly for returning students, it has now been followed more since its implementation at the start of the school year. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While most students were opposed to the rule, lower Sam Michaels described the change as reasonable. He sees it as an established layer of protection to ensure that boundaries between students and faculty, and among fellow students, are not crossed. \u201cIt makes sense, especially in all the drama that\u2019s happening with all the boarding schools. It acts as an extra layer of protection to make sure nothing bad happens,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Mizuno emphasized that while he understood faculty were trying to protect those who worked in the dorm, the rule still felt unnecessary. \u201cFaculty may also feel disrespected, but Cilleyites hold their faculty in high regard, [as they are] always caring and working so much for us. [We] simply do not respect arbitrary rules,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Other dorms have been focusing their conversations on appropriate clothing in common rooms and commonly shared spaces in dorms. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">History instructor and Merrill Hall dorm faculty member Hannah Lim acknowledged the boundary issues that may occur as a result of students wearing little or no clothing while moving about the dorm. While she personally has never had such an issue, she said, \u201cI believe there would be concerns around appropriate boundaries.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Some Exonians have been upset by rules requiring a certain amount of clothing to be worn by students in shared spaces, but many members of campus view such restrictions as a reasonable compromise. These students and faculty believe the current rules allow those who prefer to wear less clothing to be comfortable, while still being mindful of those who would feel uneasy seeing dorm members semi-naked or naked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Computer science instructor Sean Campbell, who resides in Wentworth Hall, said that Wentworth\u2019s more moderate rule seemed to strike a comfortable middle ground between those who feel uncomfortable around partial nudity and those who prefer to wear less clothing. In Wentworth, residents must wear shorts in common dorm spaces. \u201cOverly restrictive rules would frustrate students comfortable with less clothing,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the other direction, having very lax guidelines could alienate those from cultures where nudity in semi-public spaces is not commonplace.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Sarah Brown, a proctor in Langdell Hall, agreed with Campbell and also advocated for a compromise that would ensure dorms serve as a safe space for all residents. \u201cI think people should be able to wear what they are comfortable in as long as the people around them are comfortable,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Campbell went on to acknowledge that while that rule may not please everyone, it appeared to appease most people in Wentworth. He emphasized that rules around appropriate clothing are intended to ensure courtesy in dorms. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe try to advocate that the students have some situational awareness,\u201d he said. \u201cPut another way, \u2018know your surroundings.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s less about following a rule to the letter than it is about having respect for others in your community.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Dormitories across campus have recently held conversations regarding the appropriate level of clothing deemed acceptable in shared spaces.

The survey consists of 36 questions total and is divided into four main categories: general information, middle school, Andover\/Exeter and perceptions about each school academically, socially and athletically. The final data are presented on the website on a percentage basis, with helpful graphs that illustrate the specific results from each school.<\/p>\n<p>According to <i>The Exonian\u2019s <\/i>editor-in-chief Philip Kuhn and Chief Digital Editor Brandon Liu, both seniors, <i>The Phillipian <\/i>came to <i>The Exonian<\/i> with the idea over the summer. They were inspired by the annual \u201cFreshman Survey\u201d conducted by \u201cThe Harvard Crimson\u201d and \u201cThe Yale Daily News,\u201d and hoped to try their own hand at gathering data about Andover and Exeter\u2019s respective incoming classes. \u201cThe idea was really to compare Andover versus Exeter for different trends in the things we asked,\u201d Kuhn said.<\/p>\n<p class=\"pullquote\">\u201cWe wanted to see how similar and how different at least the new students coming into the school were, by numbers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Liu agreed, and described his interest in the anthropological study. \u201cWe wanted to see how similar and how different at least the new students coming into the school were, by numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe knew we probably wouldn\u2019t be too surprised by the results, but we thought it would be interesting to see what statistics we could find in the actual survey.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Kuhn and Liu worked closely with <i>The Phillipian\u2019s <\/i>Executive Digital Editor, Rudd Fawcett, drafting questions for the survey. <i>The Phillipian\u2019s<\/i> Editor-in-Chief, Juju Lane, provided feedback on these questions, and in the fall, each paper sent out a questionnaire to their respective freshman class. In the spirit of partnership even in the face of Exeter and Andover\u2019s famed rivalry, Liu and Fawcett christened the project the \u201cNon Sibi Press.\u201d \u201cNon Sibi is something that both Exeter and Andover share, and Rudd and I thought it would be fitting to title our joint venture in journalism together after \u2018not for oneself,\u2019\u201d Liu said. \u201cI think it reflects our mission as a news publication of serving the greater community well\u2014despite the fact that our schools are \u2018rivals.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Of the 221 freshmen at Andover who received the survey, <i>The Phillipian<\/i> received 169 complete responses, 76.5 percent of the Class of 2020. Exeter received 157 complete responses out of the 186 preps at Exeter, 84.4 percent of students polled. Fawcett described the survey as a big success, based on his observations at Andover. Many of the freshmen who took the test expressed greater intrigue in the portion of the study that addressed perceptions.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cStudents seemed to be most interested in the \u2018Perceptions\u2019 category on the website, which asked comparative questions about the perceived degrees of social, academic and athletic focus at both schools,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>In the \u201cgeneral information\u201d category, the demographics reported by freshmen at the two institutions were nearly identical racially, ethnically and religiously. The majority of respondents at both schools identified as white: 60 percent of the respondents at Exeter and 63 percent at Andover. The majority of students also identified as Caucasian, the most dominant ethnicity at both schools by over 32 percent. In addition, 46 percent of percent of students from each school reported on receiving financial aid of some form\u00a0 at their respective school. Finally, the 56 percent of boarding freshmen at Andover are relatively local, living in the Northeastern United States. In contrast, at Exeter, only 48 percent of boarding freshmen hail from this part of the country.<\/p>\n<p>In compliance with Exeter and Andover\u2019s shared motto, finis origine pendet, or, \u201cthe end depends upon the beginning,\u201d the freshmen were asked questions about their middle school experience and how adequately it prepared them for high school. At Exeter, over 60 percent of freshmen attended public school before attending the Academy. At Andover, on the other hand, 57 percent of respondents had attended a private middle school. At Andover, 70 percent of students who felt prepared for high school had attended private middle schools, as opposed to 30 percent who attended public middle schools. At Exeter, there was a weaker correlation between middle school and high school experience: freshmen who attended either public or private middle schools felt equally prepared.<\/p>\n<p>For many preps at Exeter, adjusting to the increase in homework and to the Harkness method can be a challenge. Although a heavier workload is expected of a transition to any high school, there is no real way to prepare for Exeter\u2019s Harkness classes. Prep Johanna Martinez said that at her previous public school in New Jersey, students would get referrals or detention if they talked during class while a teacher was speaking. \u201cAt my old school it was not good when you talked,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a little bit tough for me trying to adjust to Harkness.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In the admissions category, results show that 51 percent of the data pool from Andover applied to Exeter, whereas only 46 percent of Exeter freshmen applied to Andover. 24 percent of Exeter freshmen who applied to Andover were admitted, while 21 percent were placed on the waitlist, compared to 32 percent of Andover freshmen who applied to Exeter and were admitted, with 63 percent waitlisted. The survey also revealed that at Exeter, the revisit days positively impacted students\u2019 decision to attend the Academy.<\/p>\n<p>Prep Liuxi Sun of Exeter explained that she applied to Andover and Exeter because she knew they were competitive schools and wanted to compare them before deciding where to attend. She ultimately attended Exeter because she found that during her visits to campus, the staff at Admissions and adults around campus were \u201cvery friendly.\u201d She felt that Exeter had a \u201cbetter environment,\u201d specifically mentioning that when she could not revisit because of an unexpected event, the staff were very understanding. \u201cI just felt that the whole admissions experience was very enjoyable with Exeter,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>Prep Emily Gaw agreed. \u201cI think Exeter\u2019s a lot more friendly,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone says \u201chi\u201d on paths and you get to know a lot of people.\u201d Although both schools initially ranked at the top of her list, prep Samantha Weil was convinced at Experience Exeter that Exeter was the place for her. \u201cExperience Exeter was the smartest thing I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d she said. \u201cI went and I loved it and I loved my tour guide and the people I met and the whole vibe and everyone there was so passionate and smart and curious.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Of the freshmen who answered the questions, about 34 percent of Exonians and 31 percent of Phillipians had an immediate family member attend their school. The Academics portion of the survey revealed that almost all the freshmen at both schools prioritize academics over everything, including family, social life, athletics, extracurriculars and their faith or religion. The second-highest priority was family, by a 51-percent-wide margin.<\/p>\n<p>In the Perceptions section of the survey, freshmen assessed their own school and their rival school based on degrees of perceived\u00a0 academic-, athletic- and social-orientation. 74 percent of Andover freshmen believed that Exeter students were \u201cvery academically-oriented,\u201d whereas only 8 percent thought that Exeter students were \u201cvery socially-oriented.\u201d Over 40 percent of Andover freshmen responded that Exeter students were \u201cnot very socially-oriented.\u201d\u00a0 On the other hand, the majority of Exeter freshmen\u201356 percent\u2013perceived Andover students as only \u201csomewhat academically-oriented.\u201d Contrary to Andover\u2019s perceptions of Exeter, only 11 percent of Exeter freshmen responded that they thought Andover students were \u201cnot very socially-oriented.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In response to the drastic disparity between Andover\u2019s perception of Exeter\u2019s academic tendencies versus their social skills, prep Clara Stucke explained that students at the Academy balance academic and social life well on campus.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe definitely care about academics\u2013we are here for school\u2013but everyone is really nice and people help each other with homework all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cJust because people are smart here doesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t have a social life.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Kuhn was happy with the execution of the Non Sibi Press project, explaining the journalistic importance of making information available to one\u2019s community. \u201cWe want to make information accessible, and our hope is to document the results in the paper for our current students,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople in the future will see this as a document of what students we\u2019re taking at this time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Fawcett expressed great interest in collaborating with <i>The Exonian<\/i> again in the future. Each year, <i>The Phillipian<\/i> conducts a school-wide \u201cState of the Academy\u201d survey. <i>The Exonian<\/i> presented a similar survey in 2014, and Fawcett hoped that the board could adapt the annual project for Exeter. Although he only envisioned creating a freshman survey, since other grade specific surveys would have to be tailored towards different demographics, he celebrated the idea of projects such as a joint \u201cAndover\/Exeter day online rivalry spread\u201d or live coverage of \u201cA\/E.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Both Kuhn and Liu hope to make the Non Sibi Press annual, and to eventually survey seniors as well as freshmen.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOnce this is established as an annual thing between Exeter and Andover, it [would be] really interesting to look back from a freshman entrance survey to a senior exit survey,\u201d Liu said. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of thinking [of] long term, different projects we could do in the future and what kind of quantitative data we could compare and contrast.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>In a collaboration called the \u201cNon Sibi Press,\u201d The Exonian and The Phillipian conducted a survey of all incoming preps at Exeter and at Phillips Academy Andover.\u00a0 The results were posted on the official Non Sibi Press website earlier this week.

Your teacher assigned you to a \u201crandom\u201d group of people, and you got busy delegating components for people to do. But no one did anything. For two weeks. So now you\u2019re up at 1 a.m. working on everyone else\u2019s parts, cursing the person who ever thought that working in a group was a good idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The dynamics which arise in group projects can be troublesome, especially if everyone is competing for a grade. With glitchy sharing technology, different ideas about form and content and varying levels of motivation, a group project can easily go south and end in hurt feelings and poor results. If you are in the middle of one, they seem like the devil\u2019s favorite homework assignment. But embedded in the formatting, collaboration and meetings of such a project are a plethora of mechanisms, both physical and digital, that can make or break a group project.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Group projects are designed to strengthen team-building skills. When students have only ever worked by themselves, they are very good at working by themselves. You probably did most of your homework by yourself when you were younger, maybe with some minimal help from your parents. Most assignments for young students are geared toward strengthening their own time management skills and focus. Group projects, which begin sometime in middle school, possibly even earlier, begin to build more complex skills which you will need beyond school, such as pushing your own ideas while encouraging or improving others\u2019, keeping a schedule with a group, and sharing labor. They\u2019re skills you need to survive in the business world, and schools integrate learning these tools alongside your other subjects to get you good at them before you graduate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">That\u2019s all fine and dandy, you think. You\u2019re currently researching Native American and colonial relations, which is what your partner was supposed to do. But it\u2019s 1 a.m. At the moment all I\u2019m thinking about is the cold I\u2019ll get if I don\u2019t go to sleep right now. Why the hecky-heck do we do group projects if I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s learning anything?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The other component is ease of use. Ever notice how group projects come at midterms or at the end of the term? Teachers have a lot of grading to do then, and they can\u2019t spread it out because they have a grade-book deadline. They, too, are stressed and tired and just want to go on break. So, to meet that deadline, they give all their classes group projects so they don\u2019t have to grade as much. It gives them less to worry about. Group projects, then, are easier for teachers and technically easier for you, too, if your group functions well. Or at least functions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Group projects are probably not going away. Ever. They\u2019re annoying and a little bit silly. But they also sort of capture the spirit of Harkness. At its finest, you can gather a group of people who are of varying skill, motivation and organization levels, and together you create something which none of you could have done on your own. At its worst, even a terrible group project mimics Harkness. Ever have an 8 a.m. Wednesday morning class when no one but you will talk? Just as you can never escape group projects, at Exeter you will never truly escape Harkness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">But you\u2019re still up at 1 a.m. thinking about that cold you\u2019re going to catch. You\u2019re not thinking about the synergy of Harkness and group projects. How do you not end up in this mess again? Talk to your teacher about it. As long as you\u2019re not throwing your entire group under the bus in an angry and offensive way, you can work out an arrangement with your teacher to light a fire under your team members\u2019 tushies. You can also check in on people every once in awhile and tack a reward onto getting parts done early: celebrate by going to Stillwells after a brainstorming session; go for a walk in Swazey following a first draft; get everyone Grill cookies when all major research is compiled. You can meet at a place with food to work on it together. Make sure you get people\u2019s numbers early on in the process so you can spam them when you need components of your project. A group project doesn\u2019t all have to fall on you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">So put your markers and poster board away, file your notes, and shut down your computer, 1-a.m.-student.

Though Choate proved a tough opponent throughout the entirety of the game, Exeter came out on top in the second half with an impressive goal scored by new senior Ignacio Roitman.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">According to captain and senior Quintin DiStefano, the win against Choate was \u201cextremely important.\u201d After a difficult start to the season with three disappointing losses, the team\u2019s game against Choate marks their third win in a row after a 4-1 win against St. Paul\u2019s School on Wednesday Sept. 21 and a 2-1 win against Lawrence Academy on Sunday Sept. 25. The team\u2019s recent winning streak is a testament to their rapid improvement as they continue to work hard during practice every day and figure out their best playing strategies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The win against Choate was especially critical for the boys given the strength of Choate\u2019s team. \u201cThey are a very skilled and organized team and we rose to the challenge,\u201d DiStefano explained. Describing Roitman\u2019s second-half goal as \u201cintegral,\u201d he also praised Exeter\u2019s defense for successfully \u201cshutting Choate out.\u201d Lower Jonah Johnson and senior Collin Shapiro both listed Roitman\u2019s goal, a volley into the bottom right corner of the net, as the highlight of the game. Additionally, star goalie Max Gross stepped up with his reliable and consistent excellence, making several incredible saves throughout the game.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Nevertheless, some players saw room for improvement in the team\u2019s performance. According to Johnson, the<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>game against Choate was \u201ca scrappy win.\u201d He went on say that it was \u201cnot our best soccer, but we got it done.\u201d Though Shapiro also acknowledged that it was \u201ca tight game from start to finish,\u201d he felt that overall, \u201cIt went really well.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The victory against Choate not only boosted team spirit but proved to the team the extent of their capabilities and potential. \u201cWe learned that we can possess,\u201d Shapiro said, \u201cand that we are a talented team.\u201d It will be important for the team to keep this same mindset from their past three games throughout the remainder of the season. According to DiStefano, the team is also planning to keep their game plan similar to what it has been.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cWe learned that we can possess and that we are a talented team.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The team has an away game at New Hampton School this Saturday.
