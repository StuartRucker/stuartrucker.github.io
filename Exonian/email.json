For those of you who are bored of the same looks and want to change, we have a list of five warm and chic outfits that you might want to try this fall! If you are really pressed on time, you can never go wrong with black on black. Try pairing a black chunky turtleneck sweater with black jeans, midi-skirts or culottes. If it is more cold out, style a pair of unhemmed jeans with your favorite puffy winter coat; however wear your winter coat off shoulder to give off the perfect fall vibe. Want to wear something especially comfortable? Rock an oversized sweater with treggings\/joggers and a pair of basic white sneakers. If you feel especially dressy, try experimenting with metallics. You can wear a metallic midi skirt with a sweater and ankle boots, you can pair a monochrome outfit with a pair of statement metallic shoes, or you can style a metallic jacket with a white blouse and black skinny jeans. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Last week, Footwear News gave Rihanna the \u201cShoes of the Year\u201d award. She\u2019s the first female designer to ever win this award, creating a huge mark in the footwear world that is mostly dominated by males. Her Fenty Puma sneakers, also known as the Creeper, were first revealed during the February New York Fashion Week last year, introducing a punk vibe to the sneaker world. It received much popularity and was sold out within three hours of the released. We are happy for the artist and can\u2019t wait to see what other shoes she is going to release in the future! <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This week, S<b>amantha Olmsted \u201919 <\/b>looked cute in her white blouse, camel blazer, lace up flats, and floral scarf. <b>Bobby Murray \u201918 <\/b>wore a grey shirt, oversized cameo jacket, black fitted trousers, high top converse and snapback. <b>Alex Rothstein \u201917<\/b> rocked a pair of black pattern tights with a green t-shirt dress, oversized denim jacket and platform boots. <b>Miranda Derossi \u201919<\/b> wore a blue long sleeve sweater, floral mini skirt, grey tights and red leather ankle boots. <b>Elias Issa \u201919 <\/b>channeled a preppy vibe in his striped collared shirt, navy blue neck tie, dark blue trousers and Sperry\u2019s. The two trouble makers <b>Jonah Johnson \u201919 <\/b>and <b>Nick Tilson \u201919<\/b> have been experimenting what style really means. The wade in the water look with the evidently rolled up pants exposes their socks that feature many different designs, from the simple polka-dots stripes to the more elaborate smiling pizza faces and Christmas trees. <b>Daria Prokopets \u201919 <\/b>has suddenly drawn many people&#8217;s attention with her innovative hair styles and unique blouses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Yeezy collaboration with Adidas has been very influential. People are now leaning to more ripped, baggie and longer clothes, like the ones in Kanye\u2019s collection. Zara has even been copying these stylish Yeezy collections. We can&#8217;t wait to see what comes out next!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Fishnet tights are making a huge comeback this fall with many celebrities, models and fashionistas sporting these tights in their everyday look. You can wear these tights as an accessory, having them peak out of your ripped jeans or you can wear them as a focal point of your outfit, styling them with an a-line denim skirt. If you don\u2019t think you can pull off the tights, you can also go for the above the ankle fishnet socks. This will add a bit of edge to your outfit as the socks peak from above your shoes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> Stay stylish,<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Connor &amp; Tanya <\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Hey Guys!

Using a variety of styles and techniques, ranging from screen prints to stencils to collagraphs to encaustics, these artists tackled pertinent issues of the day, ranging from energy conservation to LGBTQ+ rights.<\/p>\n<p>Lamont Gallery Director Lauren O\u2019Neal explained that Robert Tomilillo of the Boston Printmakers approached her a year ago to propose the idea for the exhibit. The idea seemed particularly important and powerful in keeping with the Lamont Gallery\u2019s recent theme of using its exhibits to express public reactions to an array of sociopolitical issues. \u201cWe thought <i>2016, A State of Mind <\/i>would be a relevant and impactful exhibition to bring to Exeter,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s another way to extend important campus conversations.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Tomilillo, who has worked with the images displayed in the gallery since January, praised the final result of the show and commended the professional work of O\u2019Neal. \u201cI was awed and inspired by the quality of the work,\u201d he said. \u201cHanging 148 prints in the gallery was an incredible challenge.\u201d O\u2019Neal also celebrated the talent of the artists. \u201cThere is a high level of technical achievement in the works on view, and the pieces represent a variety of techniques, styles and materials,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>She went on to emphasize that the work featured in the show does not espouse one specific political belief. Rather, it demonstrates the power of art to make commentary on issues of the day. \u201cThe issues are complex and multifaceted,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are many works where the interpretation is left to the viewer. The exhibition is an open invitation to contemplate, examine and start a conversation about something important to you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Artist Mary Taylor spoke about the power of art as a means of expression. Her work for the show depicts a human head exploding and speaks to a certain mean spiritedness surrounding the election. \u201cCreative expression is critical to understanding variant perspectives on everything,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a vehicle for political or social commentary it is an extremely powerful tool\/aid to elicit different avenues of thought on any one subject.\u201d Artist Pat Conant\u2019s print \u201cThe American Eagle\u201d expressed a political statement about the ongoing problems within the country during the seventies, problems which persist to this day. \u201cPrintmaking over the years has always been a vehicle to present information on political and social distress because it can reach many people,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel artists should express their concerns within their community and world through their art as a form of expression.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Overall, O\u2019Neal deemed the reception a success. \u201cMany of the artists had never been to the Lamont Gallery and they appreciated the chance to see their work on display in dialogue with other pieces,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>After the gallery show, students performed in the gallery to speak about citizenship and politics in America.<\/p>\n<p>Prior to this event, many of the students had attended the two hour \u201cMy Take\u201d workshop in the library led by design lecturer and artist Pamela Davis Kivelson of Stanford University and by Exeter\u2019s own theatre and dance instructor Sarah Ream. \u201cMy Take\u201d served as an interactive workshop exploring techniques artists can use to respond to and frame cultural events of the day. It addressed ways to use both visual and spoken art to generate ideas about social issues and helped students interpret the local and national events around them. The workshop focused particularly on Tuesday night\u2019s elections and students\u2019 responses to the process leading up to said event.<\/p>\n<p>Senior Alejandro Arango wrote a short play called \u201cPolitical Lines\u201d, which he acted in along with uppers Jacqui Byrne, Maya Kim and Grant Goodwin. The skit spoke to the divisiveness of politics and to ways in which the country can bridge these gaps.<\/p>\n<p>Arango explained that an excerpt he read from Joaquin Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s Humanizing Opposition motivated him. \u201cIt\u2019s always been fascinating to me how invested people become with politics, almost to the point of arguing and ad hominem,\u201d he said. \u201cThe play was a jumping off point for thinking about how we should discuss politics. An idea versus an idea, or two people versus each other?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He highlighted the importance of listening to one another and understanding people with whom we do not agree. \u201cAbove all, I believe we should make a consistent effort to humanize our opposition,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s only through an unassuming and honest understanding of those we disagree with, that we can hope to have fruitful dialogues on the issues we care about.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to go beyond simply understanding that a discussion of ideas need not entail personal argument, but\u00a0 that we also cannot separate the person we disagree from their humanity,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Lower Rose Martin wrote and read a poem entitled, \u201cMy Love Letter to the Pledge\u201d, which pointed to the hypocrisy of the Pledge of Allegiance and questioned the true equality of the country, framing the poem as a letter to all those who \u201cdo not feel \u2018free\u2019 in the land of the free.\u201d At the end of her performance, she read her own interpretation of the Pledge of Allegiance, concluding the poem with the lines \u201cBe sure to write to me when that happens. Signed, The rest of your country.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>She also created a triptych of posters to supplement her poem. Each one featured a blue, red and white border and was emblazoned with Tupac Shakur\u2019s quote \u201cPledge allegiance to the flag that neglects us.\u201d Each poster displayed a different silhouette, based on pictures of faculty and staff members on campus and representing different minority groups in America.<\/p>\n<p>Martin explained that she welcomed the chance to express herself through creativity and to speak out about something important to her. \u201cIt felt important for me to do this because I felt that the best way for me to express my opinion on politics was through art,\u201d she said. \u201cI have always hated the pledge, since I was little. I thought it was not true and that we shouldn\u2019t have to recite something we don\u2019t believe in.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Upper Tim Han performed a monologue entitled \u201cConfessions of a Republican\u201d, using the transcription of an ad for Lyndon B. Johnson from the 1964 presidential election, in which a concerned Republican voter spoke out against Senator Barry Goldwater and endorsed Johnson. Martin applauded Han for his execution of the speech. \u201cTim Han has a really powerful voice and his monologue of the \u2018Confessions of a Republican\u2019 really drew in the crowd, myself included,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>For piano instructor Jon Sakata, the student performances were thought provoking. \u201cThe student performances struck me as potent interventions less into the space of the Gallery as into the space of our personal and collective held mentalities and language,\u201d he said. \u201cThey raised for me questions concerning how our mentality and discourse are formed, shaped, programmed [and] calcified.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>O\u2019Neal echoed Sakata\u2019s sentiment, commending the evocative nature of the student performances. \u201cThe student performances brought some of the issues raised by the art in the exhibition to life in a dynamic way,\u201d she said. \u201cArt is not as much of a static or stationary \u2018object,\u2019 but an ongoing conversation. Any time we can bring different voices into that conversation, we are all enriched\u2014even if we disagree.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>The Lamont Gallery hosted a back-to-back event on Friday night, starting with the opening reception for their most recent exhibit, 2016, A State of Mind, and transitioning into a student exposition of performances addressing issues that arose during the election season. \u201cI feel artists should [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","date":"2016-11-10 20:15:52","modified":"2016-11-10 20:15:52","categories":[{"id":2,"slug":"news","title":"News","description":"","parent":0,"post_count":912}],"tags":[{"id":181,"slug":"2016-11-10","title":"2016-11-10","description":"","post_count":33}],"author":{"id":68,"slug":"lleatham","name":"Lauren Leatham","first_name":"Lauren","last_name":"Leatham","nickname":"lleatham","url":"","description":""},"comments":[],"attachments":[],"comment_count":0,"comment_status":"closed","custom_fields":{"authors":["Willa Canfield, Erica Hogan"],"title-short":["Political Art"],"photo_type":["horizontal"],"photo_caption":[""],"photo_credit":[""],"photo_alignment":[""],"web-editors":["Lauren Leatham"],"highlights":[""]}},{"id":16992,"type":"post","slug":"bxc-wins-ea-matchup","url":"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/2016\/11\/10\/bxc-wins-ea-matchup\/","status":"publish","title":"BXC Wins E\/A Matchup","title_plain":"BXC Wins E\/A Matchup","content":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This past weekend, Big Red\u2019s boys\u2019 cross country team went head-to-head with its biggest rival, Andover. After a year of plotting revenge from last year\u2019s close defeat, the team worked hard on its home turf and left with a taste of sweet redemption.

In second place came senior and co-captain Garrett Pitt, who never fails to edge out a sprint and finished the race with a kick against Andover\u2019s first runner. Seniors and co-captains Issay Matsumoto and Jiro Mizuno crossed the line not far after Andover\u2019s second runner, grasping the fifth and sixth places. It was a while after that before the crowd saw any red and white singlets at the finish, but luckily, senior Isaac Fingerson saved the day, securing the win for Big Red, managing to finish as Exeter\u2019s fifth runner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cSaturday is everything we\u2019ve worked for since the very first days of tryouts.

Hits: Illmatic","title_plain":"Smith&#8217;s Hits: Illmatic","content":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIllmatic\u201d is NY rapper Nas\u2019 first album. It came out in 1994, at the height of the Golden Era of hip-hop, especially in New York. At the time New York hip-hop was being defined by harder, grittier groups such as Wu-Tang but also an emerging jazz-inspired sound. Nas worked to bridge the gap between these two sounds with his work. He was 21 years old when the album came out, and worked with some of the area\u2019s most accomplished producers to make the album.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Owing to Nas\u2019 East-Coast roots, the instrumentation on this album is very sparse. \u201cN.Y. State of Mind,\u201d the first track on the album, is carried by a simple four-note piano progression over a boom-bap beat. There\u2019s an added piano note at the end of each bar, which can be a bit grating, but the beat sets the dark, gritty tone of the song well. Nas uses stark imagery and his signature storytelling technique to weave a picture of the Queensbridge projects, his neighborhood. He touches on growing up, shootouts with the police and the drug business. Underlying the song, and the album as a whole, is a desperate urge to escape. Nas raps, \u201cI dream I can sit back\/And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn\/Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, holmes.\u201d That\u2019s the power of this album\u2014in an era of extremely hard, braggadocious, violent music, Nas is able to deliver a message of movement while still grounding himself in the common rap vernacular.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Nas is sparse with the features on this album\u2014all but two songs are done solo. That being said, Nas places his guest artists perfectly. On \u201cLife\u2019s a B****,\u201d AZ takes the opening verse and chorus, delivering some of the smoothest flows on the album. AZ steals the show here, almost making Nas\u2019s verse sound like an afterthought. The track closes with a trumpet solo from Nas\u2019s dad Olu Dara. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The second feature, on the song \u201cOne Love,\u201d is from Q-Tip, known from A Tribe Called Quest. He produced the song, and contributes vocals on the chorus. The production samples a thumb piano, which along with the double bass helps develop the song\u2019s cold, dark soundscape. \u201cOne Love\u201d is put together as a series of letters from Nas to various friends of his in jail. Nas sounds like he\u2019s at rock bottom here, and the confidence we hear in his voice on the rest of the album is replaced with a deep bitterness. Instead of coming off as corny and forced, Nas\u2019 frustration here is immediate, supported by his strong storytelling ability. Nas laments his incarcerated friends\u2019 position, but realizes that the situation he\u2019s in is not much better\u2014they\u2019re both trapped.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sadly, Nas never really penned something else that lived up to \u201cIllmatic,\u201d though it\u2019s very few rappers\u2014or musicians in general\u2014that have an album like this one under their belt. Every song here is a classic, and Nas hits every note from the braggadocious \u201cHalftime\u201d to the reminiscent \u201cMemory Lane.\u201d Turn on your favorite hip-hop single from the last 10 years; chances are it\u2019s jacking one of Nas\u2019 flows.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>\u201cIllmatic\u201d is NY rapper Nas\u2019 first album.

On Saturday, Oct. 22, Shao, a tenor saxophonist, and Stevens, a bass player, entered into rigorous auditions in Amherst, NH that required them to play complex jazz melodies and sight read jazz music, and both distinguished themselves enough to be placed in the Jazz All-State band, with Stevens making the cut for the top group of all, the honors band.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The entire band will perform at the New Hampshire Jazz All-State Festival in Feb., which consists of the very best high school student jazz musicians in the state. The festival is organized annually by the New Hampshire Music Educators Association (NHMEA), and it was created in order to bring together students from different schools to bond over their love of jazz music.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Stevens learned about the program through the director of Exeter\u2019s Jazz Ensemble Carl Benevides, who encouraged him to try out for the band. Although Stevens has played the bass for only two years, Benevides saw his innate talent through performances with the Orchestra, the Jazz Ensemble and the Big Red Blues. To prepare, Stevens extensively practiced improvising and playing the melody to the jazz ballad and a solo over B flat \u201cblues\u201d key.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Shao had qualified for the New Jersey All-State Jazz Band back in his hometown of Basking Ridge, N.J., but could not participate due to his move to Exeter. Shao later did some online research and discovered the New Hampshire All-State Jazz auditions. A panel of music instructors selected Shao as the first chair tenor saxophonist in the second band.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cThe best part about being a jazz musician is being able to express yourself freely and not having to stick to written music.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Shao attributed some of his success to his jazz instructor at Exeter, Charles Jennison. \u201cMr. Jennison has been especially supportive, and even though I have only studied with him for a short time so far, I am already learning a lot,\u201d said Shao. Jennison, an accomplished jazz musician, has played jazz since high school and has studied from such jazz masters as Jerry Bergonzi and Charlie Mariano. Jennison is a wealth of knowledge for students interested in jazz.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Both Shao and Stevens have enjoyed playing jazz in the past. Stevens said that he loves the freedom that the genre allows. \u201cI like jazz because it\u2019s all about improvisation,\u201d Stevens said.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>\u201cBeing able to make something up on the spot is very enticing.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Stevens\u2019 friends have long witnessed his enthusiasm about jazz.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Lower Dylan Yin, a saxophonist who plays with Stevens in the jazz ensemble and the EAR Band \u201cThe Stepping Stones,\u201d said that Stevens is a \u201cleader\u201d who is \u201calways making good suggestions.\u201d \u201cHe is really kind and likes to have fun with us whenever possible,\u201d Yin said. \u201cI love exchanging funny looks with him during rehearsal and jamming out afterward.\u201d Friends know Stevens as a musician who always gives his full effort every practice.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Shao said that his interest in jazz first arose when he began playing the saxophone about four years ago. He first started listening to famous jazz musicians. \u201cThere are a lot of jazz programs and players near Newark and New York City, and after learning and listening from them, I really started to love jazz,\u201d Shao said. His favorite jazz saxophonists are Joe Henderson and Sonny Rollins.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Like Stevens, Shao\u2019s favorite part of jazz music is the improvisation. \u201cThe best part about being a jazz musician is being able to express yourself freely and not having to stick to written music,\u201d he said, noting that jazz musicians still have to follow rules with their improvisation, such as adjusting to \u201ccertain chord changes\u201d in the piece.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Shao tries to practice his tenor saxophone as often as possible. He usually tries to fit in 45 minutes on weekdays and two hours on Saturday and Sunday. In addition to individual practice, Shao participates in Exeter\u2019s Jazz Ensemble. Still, he feels like homework gets in the way of his practicing. \u201cI don\u2019t really have a routine, as some days are more busy than others,\u201d Shao said. \u201cI wish I had more time to practice.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">After learning that they made it into the band, Shao and Stevens received the sheet music for the festival. Now, it is up to them to practice for the big day. Jennison knows about the process, since other Exonians have played in the festival in past years. \u201cStudents prepare the music independently and with their teachers until they attend the festival,\u201d he said. \u201cThere, they work with distinguished \u2018guest conductors\u2019 and present a concert.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Shao and Stevens are set to perform on Feb. 4 at Pinkerton Academy. Both are clearly looking forward to the event. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fun to play jazz with a bunch of other really committed jazz musicians, in a big band setting,\u201d Stevens said. Shao agreed, including that he has hopes to \u201cimprovise and solo\u201d at the Festival.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Lower Justin Shao and upper Lucas Stevens have qualified for the New Hampshire Jazz All-State band.

For lovers of the Shrek series, a taped version of the musical performance featuring the world\u2019s most iconic ogre is available on Netflix for viewing pleasure on a busy night. Although it was not manufactured for the screen, \u201cShrek the Musical\u201d combines the joys of live-acting and everything Shrek into a rendition of cheesy songs and obscure costumes. It is not as enjoyable as the original film, but the quality of the live production is certainly worth watching. We still get the reinvented fairy tales that made the original Shrek series so compelling, beloved characters such as Donkey, Dragon and Fiona, and the delightful villain Lord Farquaad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The show has slight changes in order to accommodate for nearly impossible feats such as casting a fire-breathing dragon and an actual ogre. However, the performance of Shrek, played by Brian d\u2019Arcy James, is as close as humans can get to a terrifying green monster. The addition of Shrek\u2019s parents in the beginning was off-putting originally, but now, we\u2019ve realized that it is just really pathetic and sad\u2014that only makes it more humorous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Some of the characters from the movies are brought more into the spotlight, with a few coming off as more annoying than humorous. We found Pinocchio, a seemingly average character with a typical but witty tagline, quite irritating when played by a singing, high-pitched actor. He was not an integral character in the first movie, so it did not make sense to amplify his role when it adds nothing except for thirty seconds in an irrelevant song about the fairytale creatures.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Our favorite part of the show is when Lord Farquaad sings about himself and how great of a (not quite a) king he is. The actor in the Netflix version, John Tartaglia, performed \u201cWelcome to Duloc\u201d and \u201cWhat&#8217;s Up, Duloc?\u201d with such passion that it\u2019s easy to forget that he\u2019s dancing in a kickline while on his knees. Some of the filler numbers are redundant, but the trio featuring three aging versions of Fiona locked in a tower did not take away from the initial purpose of the movie\u2019s plot since we now know much more about her life from the other films.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This musical version of the classic children\u2019s film series brings its own flavor to the original tale. Employing actors to portray the characters brings a depth that the animated version never had. We get to see the look in Shrek\u2019s eyes as he gazes upon his beloved Fiona, the pure agony Gingy the Gingerbread Man endures at the hands of the evil Lord Farquaad. However, nothing really beats a sad Wednesday evening of watching the classic Shrek movie.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Drama, heartbreak, romance and comedy: what more could you want? \u201cShrek the Musical\u201d provides all that and more, reimagining the film series we all love through song and dance.

Students sign up to represent a country and research the country\u2019s position on a certain topic. In large forums, they discuss solutions to problems with other country\u2019s delegates, attempting to come up with a proposal to present to each council.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Phillips Exeter Academy Model United Nations club (PEAMUN) competes in several weekend and two-day competitions throughout the year such as Yale University\u2019s conference (YMUN) and Boston University\u2019s high school conference (BosMUN), where they won Outstanding Small Delegation for the first time in three years this February.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The nine person PEAMUN board consists of senior co-presidents, directors of finances, training, external and internal affairs and three upper associates. Senior and co-President Kaitlyn Kang, who has been involved since prep year, said her favorite thing about the club is the people. \u201cEveryone is extremely eloquent, very tactful, and I find myself constantly learning from everyone around me,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cIt&#8217;s exciting to see that there are so many teenagers who really care about the topics that we are discussing, and who really want to come up with a legitimate solution for them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For senior and co-President Bokyoung Kim, MUN has been a chance to think in a new perspective. She has represented countries that do not share the same viewpoints as her, but she said, \u201cthat\u2019s what makes MUN interesting,\u201d because it forces her to think harder and deeper about her country\u2019s position in relation to the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Since prep year, PEAMUN has taught senior and director of finances Eric Tang how to speak to and work with others. One downside he has found to MUN is that the awards can be arbitrary. However, he enjoys it because \u201cspeaking is terrifying but exhilarating, and it gives us a chance to write our own history.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Along with educating on different stances regarding problems around the world, MUN offers a unique experience for students to meet people across the country and collaborate in sometimes unsettling issues. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Upper Alexis Gorfine noted that she does MUN to increase her understanding of the world as well as to meet people who are passionate in a similar field of study. \u201cIt&#8217;s exciting to see that there are so many teenagers who really care about the topics that we are discussing, and who really want to come up with a legitimate solution for them,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Along with this friendly collaboration comes an \u201cinvigorating sense of competition,\u201d Gorfine said. This competition provokes a demanding work ethic for students to strive for a realistic resolution. With this endeavor for a more thorough understanding of an issue comes improved skills in public speaking and collaboration. Even when students are not in a committee session, they continue to mull over issues to develop stronger reasoning and thus, a more successful presentation of their concluded beliefs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Upper Michael Bamah finds value in the club largely due to its fostering of skills similar to those used at the Harkness table. He explained that MUN allows for participants to think in a more global sense rather than being narrow minded. Bamah also noted that research on world issues has broadened his understanding of the severity of issues that can sometimes be glossed over in an everyday life routine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, coinciding with the many beneficial aspects of MUN comes with the club\u2019s heavy time consumption. Several members voiced that the workload for the extracurricular can, although enjoyable, be very strenuous at times. \u201cThe most difficult things is really just managing both Exeter stuff and preparing and going to multi-day conferences,\u201d said Jiro Mizuno. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Last weekend, the board held the 2016 Phillips Exeter Academy Model United Nations Conference (PEAMUN VIII). Twenty-eight schools had a total of 450 students attend. Delegates had nine committees to choose from: three General Assemblies, two Specialized Agencies, two Joint Crisis Committees, a Security Council, a Historical Crisis Committee and a Model Congress. Topics of these committees ranged from prison reform to the cybersecurity to women&#8217;s reproductive rights.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As co-President and Secretary General, Kim faced some of challenges while planning PEAMUN, such as coordinating a large group of people, but she said one of the best parts of MUN for her has been seeing all younger students get excited for their committee sessions. \u201cI remember going to my first ever conference as a naive eighth grader not knowing anything about Model UN and simply being told that \u2018experience is the best way to learn,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI see my old self in the delegates, and it makes me immensely happy to know that PEAMUN may be the conference that inspires them to continue doing MUN.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Model United Nations is a worldwide organization that gives high school and college students the opportunity to imitate the United Nations, learning about international relations and diplomacy in the process.

This is Exeter\u2019s fourth year participating in the event, and environmental clubs hosted workshops and projects for volunteers to participate in. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The US Green Building Council\u2019s Center for Green Schools initiated the global movement in 2012, hoping to inspire children, students and their instructors to participate in creating a healthier and safer learning environment for themselves. \u201cWhen we educate a child, we choose the future we hope he or she creates,\u201d the group stated in their mission. \u201cWe choose a sustainable future, and so we must educate students to prepare them to create it\u2014in a place that inspires them.\u201d Since its founding, more than 750,000 volunteers in 73 countries worked on improving the learning environments of seven million students around the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Volunteers had eight projects to choose from and received a free Green Apple Day t-shirt for their service. The projects included several outdoor activities such as contributing to the maintenance of the Exeter trail network by picking up fallen branches, marking trails, removing falling logs and trimming back growths. Beekeeping Club planted pollinator-friendly vegetation near campus hives. Encouraging recycling and repurposing, environmental proctors distributed hundreds of recycling bins to dormitories. The Exchange organized the student thrift store and materials that were collected in the spring that might otherwise have end up in the landfill. Taking volunteer work off campus, ESSO Beach Cleanup and DORSAL teamed up and went to Seabrook Beach for beach restoration and cleaning. In addition to this, the Exeter Wildlife and Conservation club set up motion-activated game cameras in the campus woods in order to survey and document the species on Academy property, and the Farm and Garden club planted garlic bulbs in raised beds outside Wetherell to be used in the dining hall.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cWe choose a sustainable future, and so we must educate students to prepare them to create it\u2014in a place that inspires them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe whole premise is to get students outside, connecting to aspects of our [campus] that they might not normally connect with, in particular the outdoors,\u201d English instructor and Sustainability Coordinator Jason BreMiller said. \u201cWhen there is a large group of people who are fired up to do something positive for the community in relation to the environment I think it is easier to get on Green Umbrella Advisory Board and to feel connected to it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">BreMiller, who is also co-chair of the Exeter Green Umbrella Advisory Committee, believed the day of service is consistent with Exeter\u2019s moto of Non Sibi in its selflessness and with the desire to create a community of active thinkers, particularly about the responsibility to upkeep the environment and sustainability on campus. While the official Green Apple Day of Service was on Saturday Sept. 24, 2016, the Exeter Green Umbrella Advisory Committee planned the event on Sunday so that more people in the community would be available.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Upper and member of the Green Umbrella Advisory Board Lara Galligani thinks that Green Apple Day is important because she believes Exonians have a duty to give back to the environment and around Exeter. \u201cThe earth is dying,\u201d she said. \u201cI really care about sustainability, and I want to do as much as possible to make Exeter as green as possible.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Despite the unexpected rain the morning of the event, club members and interested community members still came out to the preliminary meeting point by the track. While lower Grace Gray, an environmental proctor, thought the event would have run smoother if it was sunny, she said the rain reminded her of nature, the reason she attended in the first place. Her favorite part of the day was at the beginning, as she was surrounded by students and teachers who were equally as enthusiastic as her. \u201cI loved getting the recycling bins to Wheelwright, and when I started labeling them and the people who saw [them] were very excited and happy,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was really gratifying.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Gray enjoyed seeing people come together to make the Academy\u2019s campus more sustainable. \u201cI hope that the movements started will create a snowball effect of awareness around campus, because once people are informed about sustainability great things can happen.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Fellow environmental proctor and upper Lilly Carden mirrored Gray\u2019s excitement over seeing others participate in volunteer work. \u201cI think there can be a big impact because now there is an easy way to separate trash and recycling,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Upper and co-head of Farm and Garden Club Meg Bolan explained that the three different types of garlic bulbs they planted should be ready to be harvested around July, by then standing at a foot tall each. The group worked through the rain in the morning, and Bolan said, \u201cEveryone seemed excited and ready to help all throughout, and I\u2019d say it was a huge success.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lower Maddie Moon planted blueberry bushes with Beekeeping Club that will pollinate in the spring to support bee populations in the area. They also pulled weeds. \u201c[It] was a lot of work but really fun and satisfying afterwards when we saw how much we did,\u201d she added.

The girls were slightly tired from their game just one day prior, but they went into this game feeling ready to win. After a dominant performance from the entire team, Exeter was able to walk away with a 1-0 win and snapped their five-game losing streak.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The girls played with intensity right from the opening whistle and were determined to crush their opponents. The team quickly gained possession of the ball and formed the first of many attacks on the Thayer defense. Lower Catherine Griffin explained how important a win in this game was for her team. \u201cWe were definitely hungry for a win, especially because we have struggled in our past couple of games.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Even though Exeter controlled the ball for most of the half, they were still not able to score. However, the opportunities kept piling up and late in the first half the team finally broke through. With the clock counting down the end the half, prep Ally Decoste put the ball past Thayer\u2019s goalkeeper with four seconds left to put Exeter up 1-0.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe were definitely hungry for a win, especially because we have struggled in our past couple of games.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Scoring late in the first half definitely helped boost the team\u2019s momentum, and they continued to play strong throughout the next half. Exeter had many chances to score again, but Thayer\u2019s defense remained strong. Although the team didn\u2019t play too much defense, the few Thayer attacks Exeter\u2019s cage were thwarted by the girls to put up a shutout.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One of the major successes for Exeter during this game was that they played incredibly well together. On offense they worked the ball around with crisp passes and improved their play inside the circle. Also, on defense they communicated well and, as a result, forced a handful of turnovers. Team manager and upper Lili Hernandez noted that, \u201cthe team usually plays well together,\u201d but they worked exceptionally well together against Thayer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Big Red field hockey does not have much time to celebrate their win because they have two important games left this season. Following their game against Kimball Union Academy, the girls will take on their rivals Andover at E\/a.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The field hockey game against Andover has been a much anticipated one for the team this season. After losing 0-1 in a tight game last year at home, the girls have some unfinished business to take care of. Senior and team co-captain Abby Yu said, \u201cwe\u2019re pretty much out for revenge.\u201d The Andover field hockey team is a force to be reckoned with, so the girls have their work cut out for them. Last year, Andover won the field hockey class A championships and this year, Andover\u2019s record is 13-2-1. Although Big Red was not able to make the tournament this year, they still plan to end the season on a high note and upset their rivals in the team\u2019s biggest game of the season.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>In its third to last game of the season, the girls\u2019 varsity field hockey team played an exciting game against Thayer Academy this past Saturday.

class=\"s1\">Last year, senior Carissa Chen was running down Swasey Parkway alone in the dark when she found herself recalling vivid memories of her grandfather\u2019s stories of World War II and the Cultural Revolution of China. She returned to her room Merrill Hall and wrote three separate poems that would eventually merge into a piece that reflected her grandfather\u2019s stories \u201cof the dangers of fascist state, of propaganda, of war.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>The Kenyon Review<\/i>, a prestigious literary magazine based at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, published senior Carissa Chen\u2019s poem, Parable, in their November\/December issue this year. Her piece was published after she won a runner-up position in the Kenyon Review\u2019s Patricia Grodd Poetry Prize for Young Writers. Chen received a letter in the mail notifying her of the magazine\u2019s plan to publish her poem, alongside a copy for her to proofread for corrections and formatting details. Chen\u2019s parents\u2019 and grandparents\u2019 tales of the Cultural Revolution of China inspired her to write the poem, that she said focused on the \u201coppression of women and the desensitization that characterized [her family members\u2019] experiences.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Chen\u2019s love of storytelling was built on a foundation of childhood memories with her family, specifically with her grandfather. \u201cSitting by our blue formica kitchen table, he\u2019d lift his wrinkled hands and describe his hometown of Nanjing, where the soft slab mud swallowed sick soldiers whole,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Chen explained that this poem emerged from the stories that her mother and grandmother once told her about World War II and the Cultural Revolution. Once, Chairman Mao\u2019s Red Guards raided her grandmother\u2019s home in Nanjing, China and burned every book in the house. \u201cThose who were killed by the soldiers would just be piled up or left hanging or in the dirt,\u201d she said, recalling a startling image that she could not get out of her head.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cI feel so grateful to the teachers at Exeter for encouraging me to publish my poetry.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It was not until Chen visited her sick grandfather back in Nanjing that the stories became ingrained in her head, and she felt compelled to put them down on paper. She couldn\u2019t let go of the images that her relatives handed down to her. \u201cIt was horrible to imagine,\u201d she said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Chen said that Exeter has helped her transform from a middle school girl who wrote in the privacy of her journal to a developing professional writer. She explained that as the daughter of two engineers, she was often told that art and writing were not important. However, as she took classes at Exeter such as Art and the State and discovered the works of poets such as Maya Angelou and Audre Lorde, Chen said she became more aware of art\u2019s \u201cemotional and societal\u201d significance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">She said she never considered publishing her more serious works for others to read until she joined <i>Pendulum<\/i>, Exeter\u2019s literary arts journal. Chen also found inspiration to write her poems more seriously after reading Alice Ju\u2019s and David Leonard\u2019s poetry her prep year, both of whom graduated in 2014. Surprisingly, Chen had a rough start with Exeter English classes, receiving her lowest grades ever in her first term. After the initial discouragement, Chen\u2019s determination to improve her writing only grew. She expressed gratitude towards a number of faculty such as English instructors Matthew Miller, Mercy Carbonell, Erica Lazure and Rebecca Moore. \u201cI feel so grateful to the teachers at Exeter for encouraging me to publish my poetry,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Early in her prep year, Chen developed a friendship with Margaux Morris \u201916. The two both lived in Merrill Hall and shared a love of art and writing. \u201cIt\u2019s honestly an honor that she\u2019s been asking me to edit her papers since prep fall, and it didn\u2019t take long for me to start sending her mine, as well,\u201d Morris said. Morris felt that she is \u201cdefinitely not unique\u201d in thinking that Carissa is one of the strongest writers she has met at Exeter. \u201cWe both keep journals full of freeform writing, quick doodles, impromptu painting, to do lists, multimedia collages and pretty much everything,\u201d Morris said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Although Morris graduated last spring, they still see each other often, and when they do, they read each others\u2019 recent work. \u201cWhenever we see each other after long times apart, the first thing we do is exchange notebooks and read through them together,\u201d she said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Faculty members also recognized Chen\u2019s talent and achievements as a writer. Last winter, Chen was in Miller\u2019s English 320 class. Miller said he worked with her to further develop her writing, but he explained that for the most part, he tried to stay out of the way of her talent. \u201cI think the best thing a teacher can sometimes is give a student room to fail and stumble around a bit until they find their own way and their own voice. And Carissa is fully dedicated to doing that,\u201d Miller said. Chen wrote her poem before Miller\u2019s class, and the slow process of publication finally landed her poem in <i>The Kenyon Review<\/i>. In the classroom, Miller said that Chen is a hard worker and enthusiastic participant, eager to share her ideas with other students and dig deeper into the text.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Her writing was also recognized and commended by competitions such as the Scholastic Art and Writing awards.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>\u201cHer style is so distinctive across mediums; she has an artistic core that is channeled into whichever form she chooses,\u201d Morris said. Morris acknowledged Chen as one of the best writers she has met while at Exeter, especially when she combines visual art and writing in a formal fashion. Miller admires her writing skills as well as her development of craft and technique during her time at Exeter. \u201cCarissa is the real deal. A poet and artist of great talent and wonderful potential,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Chen felt that writing poetry was a natural way for her to express her thoughts and connect with the aspects of her life she would not necessarily address in a classroom setting. She said that although publishing the poem hasn\u2019t necessarily changed her as a person, the writing process affected her. \u201cIt made me face and reconcile my Chinese-American identity more,\u201d she said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>PARABLE<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Nanjing, China\u20141966, Cultural Revolution<\/i><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <\/span>1<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Peony petals lace the Nanjing streets, ripped in pink dissolve,<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And here, my soldier spits the wad of dope from his mouth mindlessly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <\/span>And here, he holds the hem of her honeyblue cheongsam silk, counts<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">the hooks, and trails perfect circles as a prophet down her neck.

Exeter\u2019s record now stands at five wins, three ties and eight losses. The Holderness game was very much representative of the team\u2019s performance in other games this season\u2014strong and aggressive but bogged down by an inability to score. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The boys controlled the game for the majority of the 90 minutes, possessing the ball well and generating many scoring chances. \u201cWe dominated the play,\u201d explained upper Silas Lane. Thanks to a great strike from new senior Ignacio Roitman, the team scored one well-deserved goal, while also playing solid defense and limiting the chances of the opposing team.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The first goal that Holderness scored was from a \u201cquestionable penalty kick,\u201d according to senior and captain Quintin DiStefano. Holderness\u2019 second goal came from a mistake between two of Exeter\u2019s players, which resulted in a turn over just feet from the net. Lane recalled that \u201cin a seemingly danger free situation, our center back headed it all off our own post, into the path of a Holderness striker.\u201d He continued, saying \u201cit wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s fault, just a combination of really bad luck and little to no communication.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, the many chances Exeter generated could not translate into goals and Holderness took advantage of this. \u201cHolderness had quality, but their two goals reflected our poor luck and defensive error more than their skill as a team,\u201d Lane said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Though the Holderness game comes as yet another disappointing loss for the soccer team this season, the boys are still determined to finish out the season strong. \u201cWe aren\u2019t dwelling on the game, as we have all season,\u201d DiStefano said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">He continued, saying \u201cit wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s fault, just a combination of really bad luck and little to no communication.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe simply move on and train hard to prepare for the next game,\u201d he added. According to Lane, the team has been preparing by playing small sided games in practice and working on a combination of play and finishing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The team hopes that its hard work all season will pay off in its game against Andover this weekend. After being defeated by Andover in a crushing 2-3 loss last year, the upcoming game will certainly be a challenge, but if the boys continue their strong playing and minimize defensive errors while following through on scoring chances, they could come away with a victory.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>The boys\u2019 varsity soccer team lost 1-2 against Holderness School last Saturday, marking its eighth loss of the season.

Access Pipeline","title_plain":"Dakota Access Pipeline","content":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">T<\/span><span class=\"s1\">he controversy of the Dakota Access Pipeline has caught national attention, and continuously makes headlines. Many people across the nation, along with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, have protested by attempting to block the construction of the 1,200 mile-long pipeline to transport crude oil daily from North Dakota to Illinois. Officers have arrested more than 140 protesters, including actress Shailene Woodley, and have forced activists off of the land owned by the pipeline operators.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Why such a fuss over an oil pipeline, one may ask? In the central part of North and South Dakota is the reservation for the Standing Sioux Tribe, of around 10,000 people. Their primary drinking source, along with the rest of the state, is the Missouri River. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) has reported over 3,300 oil and gas pipeline leaks and\/or ruptures since 2010. And, the water\u2019s purity can be ruined by the slightest leak. Out of concern for this, the Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners company has moved their pipeline to half a mile from the reservation, which the tribe claims runs over sacred spots and old burial grounds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Tribal leaders still argue that the federal government didn\u2019t properly follow the protocols established by the government during the permitting process, and therefore is illegal. In response, President Obama has requested Energy Transfer Partners to voluntarily halt construction on federal land. The company did not respond and has continued constructions, but the CEO is scheduled to meet with federal officials in the near future.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3 pullquote\">\u201cIt\u2019s about our rights as native people to this land. It\u2019s about our rights to worship. It\u2019s about our rights to be able to call a place home, and it\u2019s our rights to water.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The benefits of having such a pipeline include making the US more energy independent. There is a huge gap in the amount of oil the US produces and consumes. In 2013, the \u201cUS produced 7.5 million barrels of crude oil per day, but still imported 7.7 million barrels per day \u201cin order to meet consumer demands\u201d according to the official website of the Dakota Access Pipeline. The \u201cgap\u201d between how much the US consumes and produces is enormous; about 5.6 billion barrels a year. The Dakota Access Pipeline is the first step in starting to bridge that gap, in making the US more energy-independent. Also, the construction of the pipeline would create 8,000 to 12,000 local jobs during construction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Although there are many benefits to the pipeline, I strongly oppose the construction of it. As one of the protesters told Jeff Brady from NPR, \u201cIt\u2019s about our rights as native people to this land. It\u2019s about our rights to worship. It\u2019s about our rights to be able to call a place home, and it\u2019s our rights to water.\u201d Would anyone ever dream of building an oil pipeline through Granary Burial Ground, where patriots such as Samuel Adams and Paul Revere are buried? If the sacred spots and burial grounds had more significance to the average American, then we wouldn\u2019t even be having this conversation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Unfortunately, this is just another example of how the American society perceives Native-American: as an annoyance. Not just any annoyance\u2013one that asks for too much by claiming land that \u201cdoesn\u2019t belong to them\u201d although their ancestors are buried there. The entitlement of Energy Transfer Partners, frankly, disgusts me: the fact that they think they have the <i>right<\/i> to take away a part of their culture, and the fact that they expect the tribe to accommodate to their needs for the pipeline, and ignore the fact that their sacred spots and burial grounds would be crushed under it. And they have the audacity to defend themselves instead of looking for another way. They managed to avoid the Missouri river, after all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I think the fact that this is such a big deal is ridiculous; it\u2019s obvious what should be done. The pipeline should find another way to get to its destination, without going over any of the sacred spots and burial grounds of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, because it\u2019s blatantly disrespectful and uncompassionate to do so. It\u2019s definitely easier said than done, but it\u2019s also the more civil thing to do.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>The controversy of the Dakota Access Pipeline has caught national attention, and continuously makes headlines.

Just taking a shorter shower, for example, can have a profound effect. Below are a couple other of things that you can do to save resources and help to improve Exeter\u2019s sustainability.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">First, you can do simple things around the dorm. During the winter, when the heating is turned on, close your windows to conserve energy. Also, take shorter showers to save water and turn off the lights when leave a room. New recycling bins have also recently been added to each dorm, so make sure to use those regularly. There are also students in every dorm called E-proctors who are there to help the members of the dorm to become more sustainable, and they are available to answer any questions you may have. These small acts will eventually all add up, helping our school to save energy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When it comes to classes, you can transition to using your iPad or computer more often for taking notes and writing. This will help to reduce the amount of paper that each student consumes. Consider talking to your teachers about limiting the amount of handouts on paper and instead posting them on Canvas. Also, most teachers don\u2019t mind if you print your essays double-sided as it is another simple way to save paper that helps save trees and the school\u2019s money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Another thing you can do, although more difficult, is try experimenting with vegetarianism or even veganism. The meat industry, particularly red meat, is a frightening contributor to the increase of carbon dioxide emissions that have led to climate change. We have found that the dining halls do a great job of having multiple vegetarian or vegan options. While it is a challenging transition, eliminating even just red meat from your diet can support the vegetarian movement and help the environment. Even if you can\u2019t stay away from meat, try to take only how much you can eat. If you\u2019re trying something new, take a small amount before putting more on your plate. This goes especially for foods that take a lot of resources to make, such as dairy products and meats.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lastly, get involved in the many environmental clubs on campus and educate yourself on sustainability practices. This is a great way to help the Exeter community to reduce its environmental effects and to learn about the current climate issues. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sustain is a great way to start. We publish articles once a term on our website and hope to raise awareness and shed light on important topics pertaining the environment. New writers are always welcome. We meet on Wednesday\u2019s from 6 to 7 p.m. in the Sustainability Office.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If writing isn\u2019t your thing, you should still take a look at our website. We have different sections where you can get informed about issues around the world, events and clubs at Exeter or understand students\u2019 opinions on controversial topics. The website for our magazine is sustainexeter.org.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you have any questions, please contact:<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">prsanson@exeter.edu<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">lgalligani@exeter.edu<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">toguri@exeter.edu<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>It is easy to take environmental action in your everyday lives by changing your daily routine.

How are you most similar?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">8. What is your favorite\/least favorite part about being a twin at Exeter?<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Margaret Kraus<\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1. My relationship with Vivi is really loving. It\u2019s really comforting to know that no matter what I do or get involved in she\u2019ll always be there for me. We share the same sense of humor and she knows me better than anyone in the world (and vise versa). There\u2019s no such thing as twin telepathy but we can usually predict what the other is thinking or feeling in a given situation. Our personalities are very different, but this only makes us closer. If I didn\u2019t have Vivi I wouldn\u2019t have half the world view or empathy that I have today. She\u2019s my best friend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">2. If Vivi were arrested for anything it would either be protesting for human rights or stealing ten packs of cup noodles from Walmart a) I wouldn\u2019t get arrested for anything because I&#8217;m the good<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>child.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">3. Vivi will honestly eat anything but she really likes chocolates and unusual pastries like cr\u00eapes or cheesecake.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> a) My favorite food is a good bagel in the morning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">4. Vivi\u2019s music taste is pretty alternative but not quite hipster. She\u2019s the person that jammed to Twenty One Pilots before \u201cRide\u201d even got popular. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> a) I like anything with a beat that I can dance to, but also acoustic music for relaxation. Our music tastes definitely have a lot of overlaps.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">5. Thirty years in the future, Vivi\u2019s going to be a starving poet with a wife. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> a) I&#8217;ll hopefully be married with a kid or two. I&#8217;ll always make her visit me on holidays.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">6. The way we&#8217;re most different is probably that I love going out and doing things when we&#8217;re home but she&#8217;s more content to spend the day in her pajamas (not that I don\u2019t join her a lot of the time).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">7. The ways we&#8217;re most similar are that we share the same core values and have the same sense of humor. We also both have immense capacities for love.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">8.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>My favorite part about being a twin at Exeter is that I know without a doubt she\u2019s always there when I need her. It also made the transition to boarding school a lot easier on both of us.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\">Vivi Kraus<\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1. Margaret and I have the best possible relationship I could ask for. We\u2019re so different in such good ways, but we still have the same sense of humor. I don\u2019t feel any competition with Margaret and I think she feels the same way about me. We support each other in everything. I especially love that Margaret challenges me to get out of my comfort zone and try new things. I love her so much.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">2. Margaret would probably get arrested for trespassing, and I\u2019d get arrested with her because she would have forced me to pose for a photo on private property.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">3. I\u2019m not a picky eater. I like a lot of food, and I don\u2019t dislike that much, but if I had to choose I think my favorite food is sushi. I\u2019m not a huge fan of bananas, but I do sometimes eat them to get that good potassium.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">4. Margaret\u2019s music taste is very general. She likes pop and rap mostly, along with a lot of other stuff. She\u2019s got a soft spot for John Mayer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> a) I\u2019m pretty much the same, except I had a pop punk phase and I\u2019ve never liked John Mayer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">5. We\u2019ll both be aunts, definitely. I\u2019m hoping life will turn out so that we live close to each other. We\u2019ll keep up the family tradition of summers in Cape Cod so that our kids can play together on the beach. Profession-wise, I\u2019m not as sure for Margaret, but I do know she\u2019ll probably be working with people and hopefully loving her job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">6. Weirdly enough, we\u2019re so different in so many ways that it\u2019s hard to pick one most important thing. I think, though, it has to do with motivation and hard work, as well as trying new things. Margaret is very hardworking, motivated and adventurous, which are all amazing qualities. I\u2019m sort of a homebody, and I have a hard time asking for help and stepping out of my comfort zone. Margaret helps me a lot with that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">7. I already said that we have very similar senses of humor, which is great\u2014there\u2019s nobody better to quote Spongebob with. We also love each other a lot, which is a great commonality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">8. The best part is that, no matter what, I have family here with me. Our whole lives have been together, from the womb, and so I know that she\u2019ll always be there for me. I guess I don\u2019t really have a least favorite part about being a twin at Exeter, because what could be better than going to school with your best friend?<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Questions: 1.

Robb","title_plain":"Emily Robb","content":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As a fifth grader, Emily Robb was introduced into the realm of music when her best friend convinced her to join the school choir. In sixth grade, she developed her passion in debate with the suggestion of her history teacher. Back then, she had others to lead her into new passions; but now, as a senior at Exeter, she takes further steps on her own to develop her interests. As a co-head of the Daniel Webster Debate Society, Student Council\u2019s services committee and acapella group PEADs, as well the vice president of Exonians Against Sexual Assault, Robb has shown herself to be an active leader in the community.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Since being introduced to singing, she hasn&#8217;t stopped pursuing music. Currently, she develops her passion in music on campus through PEADs, concert choir and her chamber group. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Other peers in her music groups describe her as a dedicated leader who is committed to her passion of music. Senior Maya Pierce said, \u201cIn concert choir Emily is definitely a leader. She is the one who tells people to put their phones away and warm up to stop talking when we are getting a correction. She also has a beautiful voice and is very musical and leads in that respect.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cI\u2019ve become a lot more confident and more outspoken and that\u2019s probably because of the whole Harkness method at our school. I think I\u2019ve also become a lot more aware of everything that happens around me because it\u2019s really fast-paced here. Although my three years have definitely been a rollercoaster term by term, things change for me and I\u2019m so grateful to have come here.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Even during school breaks, Robb finds a way to pursue her passions. For the past two summers, Robb worked on a documentary about fiddlers. Not only did she transcribe and write press releases, but also continued expressing her love for music through this unique opportunity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI was at the 80th annual Fiddler\u2019s Convention in Virginia and it was just really neat to see 5-year-olds connect with 85-year-olds who still play the fiddle through music,\u201d Robb said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Robb also had a volunteer internship at the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, something she thought was a valuable experience for her as a debater. She did research and indexed an old case for her boss\u2019 Supreme Court case, which was about securing educational rights for illegal immigrant children.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat I did during my internship was something that I really value about debate: forming and listening to arguments about something that I am passionate about, picking them apart and figuring out how to respond to them,\u201d Robb said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Outside of her extracurricular activities, Emily Robb is known for her bubbly personality. Senior Austin Scronce said, \u201cShe has a way with people in which she makes everyone feel like someone. Whether or not she knows the other person doesn&#8217;t matter, she is always genuine and kind. She has given me a greater appreciation for what I have and she has shown me how simply a smile can change someone&#8217;s day.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Bokyoung Kim, who works closely with Robb on the debate team, added, \u201cI really admire Emily\u2019s optimism and ability to stay level-headed even during the most hectic of times. She gives off a very happy vibe to others and she always makes you feel very at ease. Both in and out of debate, Em is a very bouncy individual who is very fun to be around.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">During her three years at the Academy, Robb believes that Exeter has provided her with a life-changing experience. One of Robb\u2019s favorite parts of life at Exeter is the opportunity to share very personal memories with the people here. She has established a tradition with one of her closest friends, senior RC McShane, in which whenever they are both stressed out, they just look at each other and say, \u201cStillwells,\u201d before sprinting to the ice cream place before check-in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019ve become a lot more confident and more outspoken and that\u2019s probably because of the whole Harkness method at our school.

Although my three years have definitely been a rollercoaster term by term, things change for me and I\u2019m so grateful to have come here.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">History instructor and McConnell Hall affiliate Michael Golay added, \u201cShe has grown academically, and I think personally too, seeing how much of a big figure she is in the dorm. She always gets along very well with the newer kids in the dorm and pays attention to them.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As a senior, Robb gave advice to younger students about the challenges Exeter may bring, but how important it is to pull through those hard times and always remember that there are always people in support.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cAlthough it seems like the longest and hardest, it will also feel like the shortest time of your life once you hit senior fall, so just appreciate all of it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to appreciate all of the small things, but you just have to keep chugging along and go pick some flowers in the forest, like I do whenever I\u2019m stressed.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>As a fifth grader, Emily Robb was introduced into the realm of music when her best friend convinced her to join the school choir.

of the Week: Austin Scronce","title_plain":"Athlete of the Week: Austin Scronce","content":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The crowd falls silent as senior Austin Scronce steps up to the 30-yard line. With a sharp and swift movement, Scronce kicks the ball in a smooth upwards arc. It sails through the air, aligning perfectly between the goalposts as it flies over the crossbar. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Scronce first stepped onto a football field during his prep year at Exeter. \u201c[Senior] Spencer Nuzzo convinced me to tryout, following the all-athlete meeting with the athletic director,\u201d Sconce explained. Since then, he has gone from the position of the JV placekicker to one of the four co-captains of the boys\u2019 varsity football team.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Fellow co-captain and senior Jack Farrell commented on Scronce\u2019s improvement since his first season. Farrell has been playing alongside Scronce from their beginning on JV in 2013. \u201cAustin has come a long way,\u201d Farrell said. \u201cHe is a great leader on the field.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Scronce focuses on leading the team by example. \u201cI try to be vocal when I feel it\u2019s needed,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut I mostly try to be a silent leader, letting my actions speak for me.\u201d Lower Chimenum Tasie-Amadi attested to this. He elaborated on Scronce\u2019s impressive athletic abilities, saying that Scronce is a co-captain who didn\u2019t just inspire the team with words or pep talks, but with his prowess on the field. Tasie-Amadi especially admires the way that Scronce can be depended upon as a versatile player. \u201cHe may not start at other positions, but I\u2019ve seen that we can rely on him to step in as a cornerback or wide receiver,\u201d Tasie-Amadi said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When asked about the strategies he tries to employ as co-captain, Scronce detailed the difficulty of the position. \u201cThe responsibility of the entire team is placed on our shoulders,\u201d he said, referring to the other football co-captains, Farrell, senior David O\u2019Donnell and senior Harrison Money. However, Scronce does not let this discourage him. \u201cI\u2019m very competitive, and so I am always focused on the team,\u201d he said. Scronce explained that he is consistently as prepared as possible, so that when he is needed on the field, he can step up and put forward his best effort.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cAustin has come a long way,\u201d Farrell said. \u201cHe is a great leader on the field.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Tasie-Amadi appreciates the understated difficulty of both Scronce\u2019s football position and his appointment as co-captain. \u201cAs simple as it may look, it\u2019s not very easy,\u201d Tasie-Amadi explained, referring to Scronce\u2019s job as the placekicker. Lower Harrison Murray also admires Scronce\u2019s ability to achieve distance. \u201cHe is an amazing kicker,\u201d Murray said. Lower Alan Xie concurred, adding, \u201cHis talent inspires everyone.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Farrell also acknowledged Scronce\u2019s capacity to invigorate and push the team through his incredible aptitude for kicking. \u201cHe works hard and encourages others to do the same,\u201d Farrell said. \u201cHe\u2019s very consistent and exact. Austin makes sure everything\u2019s done right each time.\u201d Farrell praised Scronce as being the \u201cmotivator\u201d and the \u201corganizer\u201d of the team. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Scronce\u2019s deftness does not go unnoticed by his teammates. \u201cHe is serious when he needs to be, but also knows when it\u2019s time to joke around,\u201d Murray said. Postgraduate Patrick Schena agreed with Murray, saying that Scronce\u2019s personality fits the mold for being a good co-captain because of his ability to both have a good time and to focus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Many players described Scronce as a selfless co-captain; in particular, one who can be relied on for companionship and advice. \u201cHe looks out for everyone, both on and off the field,\u201d lower Peter Sauer said. Xie also found Scronce to be a supportive member of the team. Tasie-Amadi echoed Sauer and Xie\u2019s sentiments, calling Scronce \u201cfatherly\u201d and \u201cstern.\u201d He recalled a particularly difficult warm-up during which Scronce encouraged him to forge ahead. \u201cI remember when we were doing tempo runs and Austin was my partner,\u201d Tasie-Amadi recalled. \u201cAnd he was just there beside me, pushing me to go on. It was like going through hell with a buddy.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Although Scronce plays a vital role in the team dynamic, he can also appreciate the moments during which he is not needed. Scronce recalled his favorite game to be one during the 2015 season, when Exeter defeated Deerfield by a close eight points. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have to punt the entire game,\u201d Scronce said. \u201cIt was a come-from-behind last-minute victory.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This year, Exeter has faced many tough losses. One of the more distressing matches has been to Choate Rosemary Hall, which ended in a disheartening score of 0-49. The team also lost by 17 points in a game against Loomis Chaffee School. Although Exeter has not done as well as he wishes, Scronce looks toward the upcoming Exeter-Andover game with hope. \u201cThey are a very beatable team,\u201d Scronce said. \u201cI like our chances against them. We still haven\u2019t been able to catch a break all season, [but] I have a very good feeling about this game.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>The crowd falls silent as senior Austin Scronce steps up to the 30-yard line.

Bonfire Awaits Approval from Exeter Fire Department","title_plain":"E\/a Bonfire Awaits Approval from Exeter Fire Department","content":"<p>Due to recent rain, the Exeter Fire Department (EFD) has lifted its fire ban on the Town of Exeter and resumed issuing fire permits. Though the ongoing drought in southern New Hampshire had seemingly dissolved all chances of holding the traditional bonfire at this year\u2019s Fall Exeter\/Andover (E\/a) Pep Rally, the recent improvement in conditions now means that, by all foreseeable measures, the beloved bonfire will most likely be taking place this Friday as originally planned.<\/p>\n<p>Environmental Health and Safety Manager Tegan Vassillion has worked with the EFD to monitor weather conditions and secure a permit so that the Academy can hold the bonfire. Because bonfires are significantly larger than most regular fires such as backyard fire pits, the EFD does not issue seasonal permits for them but, rather, individual 24-hour permits. Furthermore, the permit cannot be obtained until the day of the bonfire, so there is no guarantee that a permit will be granted until Friday. \u201cTraditionally we call Exeter Fire Department first thing in the morning to ask for a permit,\u201d Vassillion explained. \u201cExeter Fire normally arrives around noon to look at where the bonfire will be and how the bonfire was built,\u201d she said. If all weather conditions are ideal, the EFD issues the permit. \u201cI think that there is a good possibility that the bonfire will happen,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p class=\"pullquote\">\u201cI\u2019m absolutely ecstatic that there may now be a bonfire.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Vassillion has already informed the EFD that the bonfire is scheduled to take place this Friday. Members of the EFD will be coming to campus several days before the fire to view the area where it will be held and decide whether or not to issue a special duty for an engine to be on-site during the Pep Rally. The EFD will then follow the same procedure for issuing the daily permit on Friday.<\/p>\n<p>Since the traditional location of the bonfire is currently under construction, it will most likely be moved to the Day Fields across the bridge. According to Vassillion, the bonfire will also be smaller and less robust this year since the school does not have as much wood, pallets and junk furniture stored up as it has had in the past. Nevertheless, Vassillion confirmed that \u201cit will still be a great fire.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Though many students expressed disappointment at the initial news of the bonfire being cancelled, the new possibility of having it this Friday has restored much of their excitement and school spirit. Senior Alex Rothstein declared, \u201cI\u2019m absolutely ecstatic that there may now be a bonfire.\u201d After thinking that her\u00a0last E\/a pep rally as a student at Exeter would be without the bonfire, the recent news came as a happy surprise to her. \u201cThe fact that I will now again share this memory of the bonfire with my friends and others makes me so excited,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>Seniors Bonnie LaBont\u00e9 and Graham Rutledge also expressed gratitude that the cherished tradition would probably continue for their final year.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe bonfire will be good for tradition,\u201d Rutledge said, and he explained that he was \u201csuper excited.\u201d \u201cI love fire,\u201d he added. Likewise, LaBont\u00e9 said, \u201cI\u2019m excited to see the traditional continued.\u201d Though she does not have \u201ca great\u00a0 emotional attachment to it [the bonfire],\u201d she felt glad that others will get the same E\/a experience that she has had.<\/p>\n<p>Upper Alex Renaud described the bonfire as \u201ca real boost for school spirit.\u201d He did not think that the change in location or size would have a significant effect, as long as people still attended. \u201cI\u2019m excited to just be there with the school as we all get excited to support Exeter,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, Rothstein was not upset that the bonfire would be smaller and in a different place. \u201cI just feel extremely lucky that we will have it in general,\u201d she explained. For Rothstein, the \u201cwarmth and spirit\u201d of the bonfire are the most exciting parts. \u201cNo matter what the scores are on Saturday, I am extremely pumped to support my school and wear the color red for Exeter,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Due to recent rain, the Exeter Fire Department (EFD) has lifted its fire ban on the Town of Exeter and resumed issuing fire permits.

Criminal Court","title_plain":"International Criminal Court","content":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">O<\/span><span class=\"s1\">n Oct. 22, 2016 South Africa announced that they were going to withdraw from the International Criminal Court after being criticized for not arresting the president of Sudan, Omar al-Bashir over a year ago. Believing that the ICC should not be able to control their actions and interfering with people who had diplomatic immunity they decided to leave the ICC. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">South Africa wasn\u2019t the only country to withdraw from the ICC as two other African nations, Burundi and Gambia, decided to withdraw as well on the grounds that the ICC was persecuting and humiliating people of color and had an intentional bias against African nations. These allegations were backed by the fact that the International Criminal Courts were singling out other African nations by investigating their activities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">These countries have no right to say they\u2019re being singled out by the criminal court. Yes, they make up nine of the 10 countries currently being investigated by the ICC, but rightly so. Burundi, a country on the verge of investigation is complaining about how they are being targeted as part of political bias yet their country has a president, Pierre Nkurunziza, who is seeking an unconstitutional third term in office and has been part of a civil war which has caused the death of 300,000 Burundian citizens. In his quest for a third term, it is rumored that he carried out executions and beatings for political opponents. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Gambia, the third country to leave the ICC, is also based on bias against African nations and the persecution of people of color. They believe that the ICC is only going after the Africans as they did not attack the European Union for the role in killing thousands of migrants trying to immigrate to the EU and the non prosecution of Tony Blair\u2019s role in the Iraq War. Saying that the court has made mistakes does not excuse your own. Just because the court went after African nations and not England and the EU doesn\u2019t make these countries better, these nations also committed many crimes and should be investigated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3 pullquote\">Just because the court went after African nations and not England and the EU doesn\u2019t make these countries better, these nations also committed many crimes and should be investigated.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">These countries that have made false claims of abuse and bias are making excuses for their incompetence and failures. South Africa failed to arrest Omar al-Bashir, guilty of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. South Africa believe that they should not have arrested him as he had diplomatic immunity yet as a part of the International Criminal Court they have an obligation to arrest anyone wanted by the court. This just highlights these countries\u2019 inability to arrest a person that has committed countless crimes against humanity. South Africa has no reason to say that they are being called out for incompetence when this is a one hundred percent true statement. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Nations should be able to leave from the court if they have valid reasoning to do so, but they should not make false claims or bullshit reasons that they are being unfairly treated by the ICC. South Africa has a legal reasoning that makes this fine, as they believe that giving diplomatic immunity to sitting leaders conflicts with the ICC\u2019s duty to arrest anyone that is wanted by the tribunal. On the other hand, however, nations like Gambia and Burundi cannot base their leaving on bias against them. Yes, the ICC should have investigated other countries not in Africa, but they should still investigate the African countries regardless as they also are guilty of many unjust acts. Just because someone else has done something wrong, does not give you the right to do the same.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>On Oct. 22, 2016 South Africa announced that they were going to withdraw from the International Criminal Court after being criticized for not arresting the president of Sudan, Omar al-Bashir over a year ago.

Although the majority of people have realized that climate change is a real and pressing issue, comparatively few rank it highly on a list of national issues, or even environmental ones. Climate change is overrun by concerns about the economy and healthcare in spite of President Obama\u2019s dedication to making it a top priority. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">To combat the world\u2019s heavy reliance on fossil fuels and greenhouse gas-producing energy sources, countries and private companies have made leaps in making renewable energy available to everyone. In the United States, installing solar panels on your house can give you a 30 percent tax break and reduce your electric bill to nil. In some cases, the power companies may even pay you for the excess power your solar panels end up generating. Installation costs have dropped by more than 70 percent in the last decade. More than 200,000 jobs have been created by the solar industry. Despite the incentives, solar power is only expected to contribute 10 percent of the nation\u2019s power by 2025. This projection is conditional upon the ability of solar providers to streamline and simplify the process of owning and installing solar systems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3 pullquote\">The lack of anxiety about an issue this instrumental to survival is a devastating blow to those that try to remain optimistic about the future.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The same is true for wind power. The capacity for wind power production in the United States is exceeded by that in the European Union and China. Some corporations ended construction of wind farms due to tax breaks expiring or decreasing. Europe, on the other hand, is making larger leaps in renewable energy. By 2020, wind energy is expected to produce up to 17 percent of electricity in the EU. Support for wind power in the EU averages 80 percent. Denmark\u2019s wind farms supplied 140 percent of the energy needed last year and Germany first reached its goal of using 100 percent renewable energy in March. There is no reason the U.S. government should be lagging behind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Regardless of this issue\u2019s pertinence, its attention in this year\u2019s election campaigns has been next to nothing. It\u2019s been ignored in the debates, drowned out by personal attacks and defamation. Hurricane Sandy resulted in the deaths of more than 200 people across the Caribbean, United States and Canada. In addition it caused more than $75 billion in damages, over $71 billion in the United States alone. The superstorm was undeniably linked to climate change; its magnitude increased drastically by way of global warming. More recently, Category 5 Hurricane Matthew claimed the lives of more than 1600 people, mostly in Haiti but 49 in the United States, and more than $12 billion in damages. Even though it seems easy enough for politicians to ignore the deaths of thousands caused by climate change, they cannot argue with its monetary cost, a language they all understand. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The unfortunate thing is, while the effects of climate change will affect us noticeably in our lifetimes, they will not kill us right away. But if left unchecked, it will quite probably create a mass extinction event that erases humanity from the Earth. The lack of action comes from the lack of immediacy of the threat. In a society obsessed with instant gratification, thinking about the long-term effects of climate change is an extremely unattractive prospect. Nonetheless, our generation has the unique opportunity to determine our future. We may have the sole ability to determine which path our species takes and where it leads us. The lack of anxiety about an issue this instrumental to survival is a devastating blow to those that try to remain optimistic about the future. The bottom line is this: We need to do something about it. No one else will.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>In a Gallup poll taken this past March, 33 percent of Americans said they were very worried about climate change while 40 percent said they weren\u2019t worried that much, or at all.

Back in July, the FBI had recommended that she not face criminal charges\u2014the \u201cscandal\u201d was subsequently relegated to a topic that Donald Trump and his supporters bring up occasionally to attack Clinton. However, on Oct. 28, FBI Director James Comey informed Congress that the intelligence agency would be taking \u201cappropriate investigative steps\u201d to review \u201cemails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.\u201d Anthony Weiner, estranged husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin, is currently being investigated for allegedly sexting a 15-year-old girl, and emails suspected to be related to Clinton were discovered from his seized devices.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2 pullquote\">While violators aren\u2019t sentenced to imprisonment, the most serious consequence is termination, which is what should happen to him.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Chaos ensued. Tim Kaine, Clinton\u2019s running mate, said that Comey\u2019s decision was \u201cvery, very troubling.\u201d Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta was suspicious about the timing of the decision, calling it \u201cextraordinary.\u201d Meanwhile, at a rally here in New Hampshire, Trump opened with news of the investigation, saying \u201cI have great respect for the fact that the FBI and the Department of Justice are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">His joy would prove to be short lived, as on Nov. 6, Comey told lawmakers that the FBI had reviewed the newly discovered emails and found that Clinton still should not have charges pressed against her. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Comey\u2019s actions are too little, too late. He definitely should not have even announced the reinvestigation into her emails in the first place. By doing so, he violated the Hatch Act\u2014a federal law that states employees in the executive branch of the federal government are not allowed to engage in political campaign activities. Section 7323 prohibits a government employee from \u201cus[ing] his official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election.\u201d That is exactly what Comey did. While violators aren\u2019t sentenced to imprisonment, the most serious consequence is termination, which is what should happen to him. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Two tracking polls after the announcement (<i>ABC News<\/i>\/<i>Washington Post<\/i> and <i>IBD\/TIPP<\/i>) found that support for Clinton had diminished dangerously. While a week ago she was ahead by 12 and 4 percentage points, the recent polls showed her ahead by merely 1 and 2 percentage points, respectively. It is indisputable that Comey\u2019s letter altered both polling and actual results. Whatever his intentions were, however, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that his rash decision caused voters to react negatively toward Clinton. Throughout this election cycle, Clinton\u2019s emails proved to be a sensitive topic for the American people, as it is one of the major factors that contribute to her perceived dishonesty and false political transparency. To announce a reinvestigation into Clinton\u2019s emails and abruptly clear her of any wrongdoing (again) so close to Election Day was extremely callous. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Considering that this has been such a consequential election cycle, his actions should be punished even more severely. Global stability has arguably hit a new low amid the war against ISIS, the refugee crisis and heightening tensions between global superpowers. Right now, who we need in the White House is a person with experience, not a political amateur. We need a politician who can utilize rational judgment during a time of crises, not a person who will claim voter fraud if he doesn\u2019t win and wants to withdraw America from NATO. We need a politician who can continue the progress the Obama administration has made through upholding Roe v. Wade, furthering LGBTQ rights and tackle police brutality and for-profit prisons, not a person who will set America back 50 years through pandering to fear and hatred. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">As director of the FBI, Comey should have been absolutely sure that Clinton was criminally implicated in these emails before announcing a reinvestigation and causing public hysteria. He tipped the scales in Trump\u2019s favor, changing the election results by a narrow yet imperative margin.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Hillary Clinton\u2019s email scandal was something that we had put behind us.

In the past, political figures have not been able to say certain phrases such as radical Islamic terrorism or in the case of Paul Ryan, \u201cDonald Trump.\u201d This inability has never applied to me until last night. On election night, I had this unique experience of physically being unable to say two words: \u201cPresident Trump.\u201d Now Trump supporters may laugh this off as my being a crazy liberal, but the fact of the matter is that I, a heterosexual white male, have never been more scared and shocked in my life. Last night, a large chunk of my dorm watched CNN\u2019s election coverage for several hours, most of them being Clinton supporters. The boys waiting for the election results with me were and are some of the strongest, finest people I have ever met in my life. I have never seen such strong-minded students scared beyond belief. The amount of stress, tension and despair was incomparable to any other moment I have had in my short life. And when I finally went to bed, I thought there was a small chance I would wake up and it would all be ok, but you cannot wake up from a living nightmare.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">I am only 15 years old, but one thing I can say with confidence is that uniting together to fight the revival of social conservatism is the only route to true freedom.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">If there is one thing I am glad about, it is that we have seen the culmination of the barbaric race for the presidency. But to say I am disappointed that we now have to place our trust in Donald Trump is an understatement. It is an outrage surrounding the fact we will have a Republican president, House of Representatives, Senate and Supreme Court. We voted for our own downfall as a country on election night. This is a dark, divided time in our nation\u2019s history, and although Hillary Clinton will not be in the White House, we need to do two things: prepare for the road ahead of us and keep Hillary\u2019s powerful message alive and close to our hearts for the next four years. We are stronger together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">As an avid hater of Trump, I have an inherent feeling that I should not need to explain my views. There should be no need to explain why Trump is sexist, racist and unfit to be president. Last night, America proved me wrong. President-elect Trump\u2019s plans will take us back decades socially. We will most likely have a Supreme court that will reverse Roe v. Wade and attempt to reverse gay marriage laws, a Congress that has a conservative agenda and a president that will roll back environmental regulations and background checks for firearms. Millions across the nation are forced to trust Donald Trump with nuclear codes, even when his campaign managers took away access to something as trivial as a Twitter account because of responsibility issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">There is no question that these next four years will be hard for liberals. But the way to face the issues we will have is not to dismiss reality. Our checks and balances system is powerful, but the president can make decisions without congressional support. Besides, the Senate and House is red for the next two years, meaning they will likely support Trump\u2019s policies. I hear many Democrats preaching about how this election will not truly affect our day-to-day lives, how our country will be okay. The fact of the matter is, though, we might not be okay. Our country has the potential to morph from the land of the free and home of the brave to a state of chaos and restriction. If we do not accept the actuality, Hillary\u2019s vision of \u201cStronger Together\u201d will be impossible. I am only 15 years old, but one thing I can say with confidence is that uniting together to fight the revival of social conservatism is the only route to true freedom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Despite Trump\u2019s win, I, along with many others, believe this country has the ability to head in the right direction for the long term. However, these next four years may be a liberal\u2019s hell. Some may say that is extreme and that I am preparing for the absolute worst.

More than anything, there is a tremendous amount of blame circulating through media, advertisement and everyday conversation. I find both the political sphere and the Opinions page of <i>The Exonian<\/i> to be too often filled with criticism, and too rarely opinions that offer an optimistic viewpoint on an issue. Too often we are blind to the progress that has been made before we point out its failures.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">It is time to start gauging a leader\u2019s worthiness by the significance of their right moves, rather than the number of their wrong ones.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Just in case you forgot, the Obama administration tracked down and ended the reign of terrorist Osama Bin Laden, gave insurance to millions of Americans with the Affordable Care Act, passed the Stimulus in 2009 to spur economic growth, signed the Wall Street reform, ended the war in Iraq, raised minimum wage to improve the condition of lower class workers, negotiated a nuclear deal with Iran, improved America\u2019s image abroad, worked to defeat climate change at the United Nations and for all this, he won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009. So much good has come to America in the last eight years, and I think before we embark on the shaming of another president, we need to be able to see the strides that we have already made. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">In a keynote address that Obama gave at the Congressional Black Caucus Dinner leading up to this election day, he said, \u201cBy so many measures our country is stronger and more prosperous than it was eight years ago. We know the progress we have made, despite the forces of opposition, despite the forces of discrimination, and despite the politics of backlash.\u201d Obama was correct and astute to point out the issues that have been resolved and the many ways in which this former government has protected the American people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">There is no denying the inevitable tragedies that have occurred throughout the terms of the last administration, because for every victory there is a requisite downfall. The country stands in solidarity with the tragedies in Benghazi, the Sandy Hook shooting, the Boston Marathon bombings, the terrorist attacks on Paris, the Orlando Night Club massacre and many more devastating events throughout recent history. Of course there have been setbacks and of course there is still progress to be made, but that is no justification to say that the Obama administration has achieved nothing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">It is so easy to blame, to point fingers and to hate a person in the public spotlight every day whose life is unfolded for you right out in the open. Being the president is an extremely vulnerable position. If you make one wrong move, you are under eternal scrutiny by the people. Of course each president is going to make mistakes, some more than others, but these mistakes cannot and should not be the determining mark of their effectiveness as a president. It is time to start gauging a leader\u2019s worthiness by the significance of their right moves, rather than the number of their wrong ones.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Let\u2019s put things into perspective for a moment and notice the tremendous strides that our country has made while Obama has been in office. Let\u2019s recognize all the people with new, well-paying jobs and affordable health insurance. Let\u2019s recognize all rivers that run bluer and all the soldiers who got to return to their families. There is so much to love about living in this country. Most outstandingly, we have the beautiful right to speak our minds. Slander, whether against our president or not, is abuse of that right. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">All I have heard throughout this entire campaign season, is how neither candidate is equipped to do a good job. The truth is that one of these candidates is going to be our president, whether we like it or not. It would be wise to begin to shift our energy into noticing the positive qualities that a new president could bring to the table, instead of presenting only the reasons why they would fail. This perspective would helpful for all of us moving forward, as it applies to life outside of the election as well. There are too many upstanding qualities about this country to waste it away in trashy Twitter fights about how we are all doomed for disaster.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">We need to start spending less of our energy denouncing the government, and more energy recognizing and celebrating its successes.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>The Obama administration has seen eight years of battles and victories, successes and faults, and for these both praise and blame.

It\u2019s most definitely been drilled into your head, and when not at the Harkness table you\u2019ve probably heard it used inappropriately. \u201c<i>Non sibi<\/i>,\u201d your friends say when they steal your Pringles. Though Exonians may use the motto irreverently, its intention drives our lives at Exeter, most obviously demonstrated by the overwhelming number of students who have participated in an ESSO-sponsored club. It is, arguably, the main philosophy Exeter encourages, and rightly so: It reminds Exonians daily to not be jerks, but in Latin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">There are significant differences between individualism and radical individualism.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">There is another powerful philosophy that drives Exeter\u2019s community: individualism. This viewpoint also encourages Exonians to be better people, but in a different way. Rather than promote selflessness, individualism guides its adherents to make decisions that will prove beneficial for themselves while maintaining the community around them. There is a subset of individualism, called radical individualism, which is unhealthy for the growth and stability of a society. This, too, along with <i>non sibi<\/i> and individualism, are present on Exeter\u2019s campus. There are significant differences between individualism and radical individualism.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Individualism is a philosophical belief that a person is completely autonomous, and as such makes his own decisions about his identity and actions. Individualism is important, even crucial, to a free-thinking society. It prompts meaningful and diverse strategies to approach problems, and ensures that people can protect themselves from others who may want to hurt them by making them aware that they have essential rights that need to be defended. Individualism both protects some members of society from harm and frees others to innovate. It does not come before the demands of society; a person who steals jewelry may be acting on individualistic principles, but because he is infringing on the rights of another human, society will punish him for his actions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Radical individualism, on the other hand, is the philosophical belief that a person\u2019s autonomy comes before society, and that a community must bow to the will of the individual. It is individualism for individualism\u2019s sake, and can be very harmful to constructive society. It sometimes undermines institutions put in place to protect people and targets dissenters and labels them as people to alienate. Radical individualism, like radical anything, is a destabilizing force in society which can lead to serious damage to the health of a community.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Individualism and <i>non sibi<\/i> go hand in hand. The nature of <i>non sibi<\/i> emphasizes total selflessness, while individualism supports a healthy amount of self-concern. They are not polar opposite ways of looking at the world. A delicate balance must be struck between the two, in which each philosophy aids in the building of constructive social scaffolding. Without being able to take care of yourself, you cannot have concern for others, and without looking out for others\u2019 well-being, you cannot properly care for your own feelings. They are important in every relationship you might ever have, with people, workplaces, institutions and governments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Radical individualism is the enemy of both individualism and selflessness. It alienates, destroys and divides. It does not have concern for the status of lives beyond the individual. <i>Non sibi<\/i> and selfishness must work together in order to preserve both individual rights and community safety. The balance between selfishness and <i>non sibi<\/i> is upset by the presence of radical individualism. It damages the way we think about individuals and the collective, preferring to keep its adherents focused on all the things which have gone right or wrong for them, rather than what has gone right or wrong in the larger community.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">If your friend steals the top layer of Pringles from your can the next time you buy one, don\u2019t lash out at them. Remember the balance between <i>non sibi<\/i> and your own interests. You can remind them that they are yours and they should not take them without asking. And then you should give them the Pringles anyway. They\u2019re your friend, of course, and the most <i>non sibi<\/i> thing you can do is let them eat your food.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>One of our school\u2019s mottos is non sibi, which means \u201cnot for oneself\u201d in Latin.

A president will have been chosen. A new Supreme Court justice is on the way. An entire party now needs to reorganize itself in the wake of the hurricane that was Donald Trump. I have no way of knowing, but I can only hope that Hillary won.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">Basically, if this election has proven anything, it has proven that citizens of the United States will stick with their guns and are surely not willing to back down.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">This season has been, for lack of a better word, extraordinary. It has been filled with ups and downs, insults and attacks and even memes and parodies. It has shown how this country, no matter what anyone says about connectivity and unity and whatnot, is still fiercely divided over fundamental issues. Is this a good thing? I say yes; without a doubt, it shows that people aren\u2019t afraid to voice their opinions, no matter how contrarian they are (aside from this, it also shows one of the key aspects of a functioning democracy: people having opposite opinions). Basically, if this election has proven anything, it has proven that citizens of the United States will stick with their guns and are surely not willing to back down. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">However, even though dissenting opinions are all good and fun, they have torn a gash in this country that will take years, if not decades, to fix. America\u2019s ugly underbelly has been exposed to the world\u2014an underbelly that still promotes homophobia, xenophobia, misogyny and racism. Donald Trump didn\u2019t create his own party based on a platform of fear and hate: It was always there. Buried within millions of Americans are fundamentally wrong opinions, completely outlandish lies and disgustingly outdated ideas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">This is a hard line, and obviously, I am not implying that all Americans are fear-mongering racists. In fact, I would say the contrary. A good majority of voters are not bigoted. But unfortunately, those who are shed a terrible light on the rest of us. We must keep in mind that we are all parts of a greater whole. If some parts are prejudiced and bigoted, it doesn\u2019t serve the whole too well at all. The fact that Donald Trump even had a platform really does show the steps that the United States has to take in order to demonstrate the world that we really are a welcoming country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Donald Trump\u2019s platform was one that appealed to many Americans. Why? He used scare-tactics and preyed upon the insecurities of Americans. He told them Mexicans were hopping the border left and right, bringing drugs and crime. He told them the Muslims were conspiring and complacent with terrorist attacks. He told them that China created global warming as a hoax in order to further their economy whilst crippling ours. All of these completely outrageous lies were accepted because Americans were scared of everything: their financial lives after \u201908, terrorism, job insecurity. Trump plucked these nerves and in doing so, manipulated the GOP into doing exactly what he wanted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">It goes without saying that American democracy cannot run without dissenting opinions. But sometimes, these opinions get out of hand. Racist demagogues should not have a platform. Racist voters should not be able to sway an election with ease. Crazies on both sides of the political spectrum really shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously at all. Yet even though they shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously (and most certainly shouldn\u2019t run for president), many have the capacity to offer insightful perspectives and open one\u2019s eyes to new opinions on different subjects. They aren\u2019t really there to change your mind or convert you to their skewed ideologies; instead, they\u2019re there to help people make their own moderate decisions. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>By the time this piece reaches the public, our country will have already decided its future for the next four years and onwards.

That was a determination we had to make in the days, months and years leading up to Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016, and not in the days after.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Donald Trump is the 45th president of the United States of America.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">That is fact. We must accept this. And we must come to terms with it; for that recognition is the only way forward.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">America has voted. Our representative democracy has fairly elected Trump, and that is simply not debatable. We have, in accordance with every American ideal, elected the president that the \u201cmajority\u201d of Americans wanted (sure, Clinton won the popular vote, but that\u2019s not how our system works; if we want to change our system, that\u2019s another problem for another day).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">But Trump won this election; he won the presidency. Our focus must now pivot to moving forward, to acceptance. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Lingering a moment longer on whether we agree with America\u2019s decision will only deepen the already cavernous rift between us all. We are a country, and a country that must remain a united front in the coming years of turmoil. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">If we accept the division among us, if we fight instead of working with, we only perpetuate the destruction of the already fragile fabric of democracy. If we accept the division among us, we tear the threads of unity that have held this country together for 238 years. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">America is a resilient country. And yet our darkest hours have come when we refuse to accept the humanity of the minority. Tuesday, the uneducated white population has reclaimed its dominance over minorities. It\u2019s as simple as that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The appropriate response to a Trump presidency is unclear. But I can assure you that fighting every second of it is worse than letting it run its course. The answer isn\u2019t opposition. It\u2019s unity. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Let\u2019s come together. Let\u2019s not fight this together, let\u2019s embrace this together. A unified country under a tyrannous administration is vastly better than a discordant one under the same, tyrannous administration. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">For today though, and just today, let\u2019s sit with Tuesday night\u2019s result.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Let\u2019s recognize that everything that Hillary stood for, everything she represented for feminism and for woman\u2019s rights was overpowered by good-old white, male supremacy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">For now, let\u2019s be sad about it. For now let\u2019s let it sink in; let it consume us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">But when we wake up tomorrow, and the next day, and the next, let\u2019s rise up and fight it\u2014not with violence, not with aggression, but with love, togetherness, and unity.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Let\u2019s take stock.

It has never been an organization for low-paying white workers to express their xenophobia and hatred with impunity. It has never been a supporter of protectionism or a flatterer of corrupt regimes like Russia\u2019s. Yet Trump has changed all of that. While his outsider view of politics attracted many voters during the primaries, it has alienated core Republican leaders\u2014Paul Ryan, Michael Bloomberg\u2014and has provoked many educated Independents to vote Democrat. More importantly, Trump has devastated the reputation of the Republican Party in the eyes of most millennials, who grew up in a world that mandated political correctness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">Donald Trump has committed himself to being the voice of those left behind in the past eight years.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">I am not a Donald Trump supporter and nor am I a solid Republican. I nevertheless have faith that there must be logical reasons to explain the decision of more than half of America\u2019s population. In the end, citizens vote not on candidates\u2019 personalities, but rather on the effect their plans will have on their lives. The vote of a corn farmer in Iowa does not hinge on the gender of the candidate, but on that candidate\u2019s opinion on trade with developing agricultural nations. The vote of a Cuban Floridian hinges not on the political correctness of the candidate, but on that candidate\u2019s opinion on Obama\u2019s diplomatic relations with Cuba. Unfortunately, many millennials have blamed the outcome of the election on the appeal of Trump\u2019s misogynistic and racist comments to many working class white voters instead of delving deep into the reasoning of Trump supporters.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">For eight years, Obama has worked with liberal media to harass any beliefs that do not coincide with his administration. No longer can you say \u201cradical Islam\u201d in public. No longer can you honor a police officer without being called \u201cracist.\u201d No longer can you praise Israel\u2019s economic growth without being considered a fervent anti-Muslim extremist\u2026 at least in California. Many of these tacit restrictions on free speech have aggravated Americans. Donald Trump has committed himself to being the voice of those left behind in the past eight years. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">It is easy to applaud President Obama for steady job growth, but it is much harder to sympathize with workers in Detroit car companies, Pennsylvania steel factories and Kentucky coal mines. It is easy to glorify the idea of free college\u2014doesn\u2019t everybody want it?\u2014but it is much harder to realize the financial burden such a plan imposes on middle-class voters. It is easy to admire the notion of universal health care, but it is much harder to admit to the rising insurance premium costs and to empathize with patients who wait weeks and sometimes months for vital doctor appointments. It is easy to make frivolous concessions to Iran, but it is much harder to recognize the aggressive hostility of most Iranians towards the United States and confess to the failure of the International Atomic Energy Agency in the past to execute reliable inspections. Many Americans are tired of initiatives that sound lyrical out loud but that quickly decay in practice. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">As Exonians, we often lose track of the real world: the ghost towns of the Rust Belt, the long lines at healthcare clinics and the high income taxes. The election serves as a wake-up call to those Democrats who were certain about a Clinton presidency on Tuesday morning, to those Democrats who smiled at Clinton\u2019s proposals but overlooked her ties with the Saudi government and her disregard for the rule of law.

We gathered in the church to hear Matt Miller discuss masculinity, white supremacy and violent men; we exchanged hugs on the paths; classes closed their doors and stepped away from the white boards to weep and sigh. As Duncan Holcomb told his fiction class, \u201cThere is an elephant in the room.\u201d In January, that elephant will sit down in the oval office, a fact that scares and shocks <i>The Exonian<\/i>\u2019s Editorial Board. But we must not simply mourn. Our shock proves our separation from the many Americans who support Trump and validates their claim that they have been forgotten in government. Our shock also affirms our status as a campus comprised of privileged students, most of whom are white. Those who leave this election less surprised are Americans of color, who are so used to decisions that ignore and hurt them that this is just another to throw on the pile. Our surprise is our privilege. However, this election isn\u2019t something we should grow accustomed to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">We feel shocked because Exeter\u2019s mask of liberal elitism has blinded us to the reality of white America\u2019s demands.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Most of our editors were \u201cwith her.\u201d But now we need to be with America, every part of it. We need to peacefully let Trump become president, but we also need to be with everyone who feels or is disenfranchised by him. Because we cannot listen to a whiter, more rural population and ignore those who have faced oppression for so long. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Like shocking news from a doctor, the election can serve as a national check-up. Many of us did not know or did not believe that nearly half of voting Americans were willing, or even enthusiastic, to support a candidate who has run a campaign so vastly different, unrestrained and unprecedented from those we have seen in our country in the past. So many have taken to social media to voice their incredulity. Incredulity in the face of polls that flipped before our eyes is fair. But the movement to denounce Trump entirely is not. The hashtag \u201c#notmypresident\u201d does not facilitate and honor the peaceful transition of power. He is now the president for every citizen of our country and any onlooker from around the world. These votes came from Americans.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">We feel shocked because Exeter\u2019s mask of liberal elitism has blinded us to the reality of white America\u2019s demands. If the country has called for Trump, then his presidency is legitimate. However, it is upsetting to realize that a vast section of our population is willing to brush off his disrespect for minorities and women. If an over-qualified female candidate can not beat a man with more than a dozen sexual assault allegations under his belt, then the ceiling is not made of a material like glass. But this is not news. It is simply an affirmation that progress we hoped had occurred and was under our belts, is not, in fact, achieved.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The fact that the executive power, the Senate and the House of Representatives is in the power of a single party will undoubtedly have serious impacts on legislation in coming years. Merrick Garland has been blocked from a seat on the Supreme Court, meaning the next nominees will be Republican and sympathetic to conservative causes. This election also marks the second time in the past four presidential elections that the winner of the popular vote has not won enough electoral college votes to become president. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Trump\u2019s actions as president probably will not align with his campaign\u2019s promises. He said what would appeal to the demographic he was targeting, and it is hard to predict what he truly believes. But this unpredictability is terribly dangerous, too. No matter what happens, we have to respect the results of the election in order to preserve whatever vestiges remain of our democracy. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>An air of grievance overwhelmed our campus yesterday.

Around campus and into the early hours of Wednesday, people reacted in both celebration and tears. For all those watching, regardless of political affiliation, it was an extremely emotional night with an end that few, if any, pollsters predicted.<\/p>\n<p>The differences in reaction on campus highlight the political divide that became increasingly clear over the course of Tuesday night. On a campus where faculty members and students tend to be liberal, lower Ashley Lin said that \u201c[p]eople are afraid to say their views.\u201d She said that in the wake of the announced results, students are being \u201cintolerant\u201d to conservative ideas. On Wednesday, Lin stood up to defend a prep at cross country practice who was yelled at for sporting a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat.<\/p>\n<p>As adviser to Exeter Democratic Club, mathematics instructor Catherine Holden has encouraged students to \u201cbehave respectfully toward each other regardless of political affiliation.\u201d She stressed the value of being open to discuss differing opinions.<\/p>\n<p>But still, the surprise of the night\u2019s results hit many students. \u201cFrankly, I am still in disbelief,\u201d senior Bonnie LaBont\u00e9, who is a co-head of Exeter Political Union (EPU), said. On Tuesday evening, she attended several watch parties and assumed that Clinton was only behind because the votes in urban areas had yet to be processed. However, as the night progressed, she was surprised to see Trump still in the lead. She said she wasn\u2019t ready to accept the results until midnight.<\/p>\n<p class=\"pullquote\">\u201cI understand he wo\u00ad\u00adn, but I don\u2019t think that anybody, Republican or Democrat or third party, looks at this as a win.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>LaBont\u00e9 hoped that, as president, Trump will return to his \u201cmore moderate views,\u201d as she thinks he \u201cwent rogue\u201d during his campaign and the election season. \u201cBut I think I am being optimistic,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis victory is popping the Exeter bubble in a sense,\u201d upper Anzi DeBenedetto said. While he couldn\u2019t vote in the election, DeBenedetto supported Trump throughout the election. He thought the results of the election have forced progressive, left-leaning Exonians to \u201cconfront the fact that plenty of Americans are not satisfied with America.\u201d For DeBenedetto, and, in his opinion, \u201clots of people,\u201d economic and foreign policy matter more than social issues.<\/p>\n<p>Lower Christine Baker agreed that some liberals are treating Trump\u2019s victory with too extreme of a reaction. \u201cThey think Trump is going to bully America, but these people are bullying Trump supporters,\u201d she said. Baker also pointed out that Trump will need to go through many steps before he can pass any laws or make significant decisions.<\/p>\n<p>LaBont\u00e9 agreed that Trump\u2019s \u201cirrational\u201d ideas can not pass easily through the system. While Republicans won the majority in both\u00a0the Senate and House of Representatives, she does not think that they will always agree with or help Trump. \u201cI understand he wo\u00ad\u00adn, but I don\u2019t think that anybody, Republican or Democrat or third party, looks at this as a win,\u201d she said. She hopes Democrats will take back the senate at midterm elections in two years.<\/p>\n<p>According to the exit polls conducted by CNN, the majority of Trump\u2019s supporters are white males and females above the age of 45 and nearly 75 percent of Clinton\u2019s supporters are not white. Over 50 percent of white women voted for Trump.<\/p>\n<p>According to senior Kelvin Green, the election result revealed \u201ca truth in America\u201d that most minorities and marginalized groups already knew. \u201cA large percentage of white America, albeit white men who can vote, are willing to fight for who and what they want even if it means that it comes at the expense of others,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is white privilege.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>On Wednesday morning, math instructor Sami Atif, who is an adviser to the Afro-Latino Exonian Society, posted a statement on his classroom door. It began with \u201cthis how WE felt after,\u201d and then listed the names of around twenty people of color who died under the responsibility of law enforcement, bolding Mike Brown, Tamir Rice, Freddie Gray and Trayvon Martin. Atif concluded his statement by providing his email preceded by, \u201cHurts? If you\u2019re ready to build I can be reached at&#8230;\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The result of Trump\u2019s victory was particularly stunning to some of the feminists in the Exeter community. Senior Charlotte Sununu, a co-head of Feminist Club, expressed her disappointment in the outcome of the election, \u201cnot just because we missed the opportunity to elect our first woman president but because of who the country chose to elected in her place,\u201d she said. Sununu was especially surprised at the demographic of white women who voted for Trump. \u201cI think it\u2019s astounding that a majority of white women are content not only to overlook Trump\u2019s misogyny but willing to be silent on issues of race that disproportionately affect women of color,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>Senior Sydney Yoon, another co-head of Feminist Club, agreed with Sununu that \u201ca Trump presidency is a massive setback.\u201d She articulated, \u201cspecifically in terms of feminism, all of us must support those most at risk from a Trump presidency: women of color, LGBT+ women, immigrant women and women seeking reproductive and\/or religious freedoms.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Although Yoon expressed her fear for the fate of these minority groups, she also proposed a plan for how the Exeter community can move forward and treat this news with proactivism. \u201cTrump has appealed to many through fear mongering and resentment. Exonians cannot allow the same sentiments to infect our campus and our peers,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the presidential race, Exonians were also staying updated on the outcome of the races in New Hampshire for governor, U.S. and state senate elections. There were two members of the Exeter community who ran for public office in New Hampshire. Governor Maggie Hassan, wife of former principal Tom Hassan, won the senate seat against incumbent Kelly Ayotte. Hassan won a close race, edging out Kelly Ayotte by fewer than 750 votes in a count that took a full day to count. Alexis Simpson, wife of religion instructor Thomas Simpson, lost in the race for State Senate of the 23rd district of New Hampshire to Republican William Gannon. Colin Van Ostern was also a competitive nominee in the race for NH governor. Labonte commented, \u201cI very much supported Colin Van Ostern and am disappointed to see him lose, but I am happy for Maggie\u2019s victory in the senate.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Thomas Simpson congratulated his wife, praising her \u201cselfless and bridge-building campaign.\u201d She gained the approval of many groups who advocated for LGBTQ+ and women\u2019s rights, teachers, social workers, police and firefighters. \u201cUnfortunately, it wasn\u2019t enough this time,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>In the late hours of this election, PEA has been divided in its political views, but united in the knowledge that we will face whatever the future brings together. Around campus, students exchange hugs, tears and conversations about the coming years. Yoon encouraged students to avoid letting these conversations become tainted with with anger and rhetoric, as they only generate an unhealthy political community for Exeter. She urged students to \u201cspeak our minds, but do so intelligently; articulate; do not dive into opposition blindly.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Late Tuesday night, students and faculty members gathered in dorm common rooms, awaiting the announcement of the winner of the 2016 presidential election: Donald Trump.

The survey also showed that upperclassmen were less approving of the Academy\u2019s response to the <i>Globe<\/i> articles than underclassmen, and were more likely to think that the Academy has a sexual misconduct problem.<\/p>\n<p class=\"pullquote\">\u201cI think that with Exeter being a place that claims to be extraordinary and full of exceptional people, we need to hold it to an exceptional standard.

Furthermore, 44 percent felt unconfident or very unconfident that the school would responsibly handle the situation. Of the 52 respondents who identified as sexual assault victims and have not reported their assaults, 47 answered that they would not consider coming forward.<\/p>\n<p>Interim co-Director of Student Wellbeing Tina Sciocchetti acknowledged the difficulty of drawing conclusions from the data given the nature of the questions. For example, she noted the confusion present in the question about there being a sexual misconduct at Exeter because \u201cproblem\u201d can be interpreted in several ways. Questioning the validity of the results, Sciocchetti said, \u201cI can say with confidence that my experience in handling any matters of potential sexual misconduct since early September does not comport with the numbers reflected below.\u201d She continued,\u00a0saying, \u201cto the extent the results actually reflect a reluctance to report sexual misconduct, I strongly encourage anyone who believes he or she has been a victim of assault to come forward.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Since last spring, the <i>Globe<\/i> has published a series of articles on cases of sexual misconduct at the Academy, including one released last summer about a case involving two members of the class of 2016 that occurred during the 2015-2016 school year. In response, the administration has made several changes to student rules and the school\u2019s administrative structure. The school has also created a new position, the Director of Student Wellbeing. Dance and theatre rehearsal spaces and art studios are no longer open to students without faculty supervision.<\/p>\n<p>Lower Lydia Anderson was made ill-at-ease by the revelations from the Globe articles. \u201cIt was uncomfortable to know that something like that had happened, and it was a secret and they had handled it so badly.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17092\" src=\"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Trust-in-school-Exonian1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1504\" height=\"754\" srcset=\"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Trust-in-school-Exonian1.png 1504w, https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Trust-in-school-Exonian1-768x385.png 768w, https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Trust-in-school-Exonian1-525x263.png 525w, https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Trust-in-school-Exonian1-140x70.png 140w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1504px) 100vw, 1504px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Senior Kelechi Nwankwoala\u2019s views of the administration were unchanged by the Globe articles.

I think I\u2019m justified in expecting more from it [than I would another secondary school].\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For senior Charis Edwards, the administration\u2019s reaction to the <i>Globe\u2019s <\/i>coverage has affected her perspective of the school more than the initial coverage did. \u201cI think that my mixed feelings about the administration have come even more from the response on campus after the article and the fear, even more than the article.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Edwards was specifically upset because she felt that the administration was not transparent about the changes it has made. \u201cI\u2019m really disappointed in the administration\u2019s lack of communication on the changes that are happening&#8230;I think it\u2019s just irresponsible and it makes it look like the administration is just trying to take the back alleys when I don\u2019t think they even are.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Some upperclassmen also observed a double standard present on campus; while students are encouraged to engage in healthy sexual relationships, these students feel the school does not provide a clear way for them to do so.<\/p>\n<p>Senior Claire Dauge-Roth, president of the Exonians Against Sexual Assault, observed a contradiction in how the school\u2019s administration dealt with student sexuality. While the school implicitly acknowledges that student sexual activity occurs, no safe space is provided for such activity. \u201cThere are condoms in the health center, but the only time that you can have the other gender in your dorm is during [visitations] where the door is open so you\u2019re obviously not going to have sex then.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Edwards felt that the school\u2019s response hasn\u2019t adequately addressed the campus\u2019 root problem, but rather addressed the symptoms of an unhealthy sexual culture. \u201cIf people are inclined to engage in sexual misconduct, I don\u2019t think that being in a different building is going to change that root issue,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>Although the Academy provides mandatory education and programming on healthy sexual relationships, Edwards felt that there was \u201ca lack of education on how to not be ashamed when having a discussion on sexuality, and therefore how to be honest when talking about sexuality.\u201d She pointed out that conversations on healthy sexual relationships must come hand in hand with those on unhealthy sexual relationships. \u201cIf everyone can be open about what they are doing then we can talk about what we\u2019re not doing, and the grey areas,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>Dauge Roth expressed a similar view. She felt that the conversations taking place on campus around unhealthy sexual relationships should be supplemented by those on healthy sexual relationships: \u201cThey\u2019re telling us what\u2019s bad but what is good?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Upper Charlotte Polk felt that this lack of discussion led Exonians to avoid questioning the status quo of the sexual culture and climate. \u201cWe normalize a lot of things on this campus that really aren\u2019t normal and should not be normalized.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Describing a conversation with a female friend, Polk recalled that the friend had felt \u201cdirty and gross\u201d after a sexual encounter. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t come out of a sexual encounter feeling terrible about yourself. That\u2019s not something that should happen,\u201d Polk said.<\/p>\n<p>While Dauge Roth felt that great progress had been made towards remedying issues in the campus\u2019 sexual culture, she felt that there remained room for change. \u201cYou get touched under the table. People are rating other people&#8230; I don\u2019t think we have a campus where everyone takes the little actions that are the foundations of rape culture seriously.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>A survey of the student body on sexual misconduct and the sexual climate at Exeter conducted by The Exonian last week revealed that older students were more likely than younger students to have become less trusting of the administration in the wake of The Boston [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","date":"2016-11-10 05:00:05","modified":"2016-11-10 20:15:52","categories":[{"id":7,"slug":"featured","title":"Featured","description":"","parent":0,"post_count":613},{"id":2,"slug":"news","title":"News","description":"","parent":0,"post_count":912}],"tags":[{"id":181,"slug":"2016-11-10","title":"2016-11-10","description":"","post_count":33}],"author":{"id":68,"slug":"lleatham","name":"Lauren Leatham","first_name":"Lauren","last_name":"Leatham","nickname":"lleatham","url":"","description":""},"comments":[],"attachments":[{"id":17092,"url":"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Trust-in-school-Exonian1.png","slug":"trust-in-school-exonian1","title":"","description":"","caption":"","parent":17069,"mime_type":"image\/png","images":{"full":{"url":"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Trust-in-school-Exonian1.png","width":1504,"height":754},"thumbnail":{"url":"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Trust-in-school-Exonian1-150x150.png","width":150,"height":150},"header-wide-top":{"url":"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Trust-in-school-Exonian1-940x303.png","width":940,"height":303},"header-wide-center":{"url":"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Trust-in-school-Exonian1-940x304.png","width":940,"height":304},"header-wide-bottom":{"url":"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Trust-in-school-Exonian1-941x303.png","width":941,"height":303},"header-medium-top":{"url":"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Trust-in-school-Exonian1-620x222.png","width":620,"height":222},"header-medium-center":{"url":"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Trust-in-school-Exonian1-620x223.png","width":620,"height":223},"header-medium-bottom":{"url":"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Trust-in-school-Exonian1-621x222.png","width":621,"height":222},"header-small-top":{"url":"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Trust-in-school-Exonian1-220x115.png","width":220,"height":115},"header-small-center":{"url":"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Trust-in-school-Exonian1-220x116.png","width":220,"height":116},"header-small-bottom":{"url":"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Trust-in-school-Exonian1-221x115.png","width":221,"height":115},"medium-vertical":{"url":"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Trust-in-school-Exonian1-240x300.png","width":240,"height":300},"medium-landscape":{"url":"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Trust-in-school-Exonian1-400x300.png","width":400,"height":300},"medium-flexheight":{"url":"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Trust-in-school-Exonian1-525x263.png","width":525,"height":263},"small-flexwidth":{"url":"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Trust-in-school-Exonian1-140x70.png","width":140,"height":70},"small-square":{"url":"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Trust-in-school-Exonian1-150x150.png","width":150,"height":150}}}],"comment_count":0,"comment_status":"closed","custom_fields":{"authors":["Grace Carroll, Erica Hogan, Emily Pelliccia"],"title-short":["Sexual Misconduct Explored"],"photo_type":["horizontal"],"photo_caption":[""],"photo_credit":[""],"photo_alignment":[""],"web-editors":["Lauren Leatham"],"highlights":[""]}},{"id":16976,"type":"post","slug":"girls-cross-country-beats-andover","url":"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/2016\/11\/10\/girls-cross-country-beats-andover\/","status":"publish","title":"Girls\u2019 Cross Country Beats Andover","title_plain":"Girls\u2019 Cross Country Beats Andover","content":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Red jerseys line up next to blue ones as the gun fires into the air at the annual E\/a cross country race. This is the meet to which the whole season has lead up. The competition was very high, and the score was the closest that the team has come to losing this whole season. Andover had two of the top runners in the league on their team, one of them a postgraduate. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Despite the selective strength of Andover\u2019s team, Exeter had a much deeper reservoir of talent, taking places 3-8 just below their top runners. Because of this more evenly balanced fortitude, Exeter pulled away from Andover with a win of 25-31 (the lower score is better in cross country), making this an undefeated season. Exeter will move to their big Interscholastic race this Saturday, Nov. 12.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">&#8220;I\u2019d say I personally felt pretty prepared and excited going into the race because I knew that we\u2019d trained hard these past months and the time has come to give it my best and work well with my team.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Exeter JV had their Andover meet last Wednesday and had no difficulty sweeping Andover with a score of 17-46. Building off of this momentum, varsity trained vigorously all season and was fired up to take the starting line next to Blue. Senior and co-captain Sarah Brown commented on what it was like to finally win an E\/a race in her four years here. \u201cIt was amazing to win,\u201d she said, \u201cWe haven\u2019t beat[en] Andover in many years and our team has been building in strength. To see our training and teamwork pay off was fun and our team was so happy.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This race was especially fun and memorable because it took place on our home course. Throughout the season, Exeter has become so familiar with their course that it acted as a huge advantage when it came time for the race. Upper Sara Kopunova said, \u201cThe race felt easier since we know our home course so well.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lower Grace Gray echoed Kopunova. \u201cIt was nice to race on our home course, and our new finish into the stadium was especially fun.\u201d Brown also agreed that \u201cit was good to have the home course advantage.\u201d Their new ending in the stadium was a great way to celebrate the win and a fun touch on the competition. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, this day did not come without an extreme amount of work. Exeter has trained so hard for this moment and they recognize that their success is all due to the teamwork and committed training that they have done this season. Gray said, \u201cI\u2019d say I personally felt pretty prepared and excited going into the race because I knew that we\u2019d trained hard these past months and the time has come to give it my best and work well with my team.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Exeter will match up with Andover again at the Interscholastics race on the 12th, so the team urges supporters to come out and cheer them on. This race will take place during some of the other away games at Andover on Saturday, but if you missed a bus or can get back early, Exeter Girls Cross Country would love to see you there to witness their undefeated season first hand. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>Red jerseys line up next to blue ones as the gun fires into the air at the annual E\/a cross country race.
