        "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Office of Multicultural Student Affairs (OMSA) will hire a full-time Associate Dean of Multicultural Affairs, a new position in the department. A search committee narrowed down the candidates to three finalists who will come to campus and be interviewed by students, faculty and staff. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">According to the Dean of Multicultural Student Affairs Rosanna Salcedo, the department hopes to hire the new associate dean this fall. The position was posted on the employment opportunities page of the Academy\u2019s website this past summer. The search committee, which was comprised of six faculty and administrative members, read the resumes of each candidate and conducted phone interviews with them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Salcedo said the team is searching for people who bring additional expertise to the community and show a commitment and desire to promote equity and diversity by working closely with students and colleagues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">&#8220;Passion for the work, enjoyment of high school students and a boarding environment and flexibility given the role\u2019s demands are all important.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">English instructor Alex Myers, a member of the search committee, added that they were looking for someone who has had previous work in diversity and educational settings. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He said it was difficult to narrow down the \u201ctalented pool of applicants\u201d and that the team spent a lot of time looking through, discussing and considering their options. \u201cI think those who currently work in [the OMSA] do a fantastic job,\u201d he said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In his opinion, the amount of work for the OMSA has grown too large for the three current staff members, and the addition of this position will help distribute the work of program and project planning as well as the increasing demand for student support on campus. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Having served five terms as the Interim Dean of Multicultural Affairs, religion instructor Russell Weatherspoon is familiar with many of the issues on campus, such as the lack of support for students from underrepresented groups. He explained that several students call the OMSA home and that several adults also pass through the office seeking guidance. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In his opinion, it has needed more staff for years. When it came to narrowing down the candidates, he didn\u2019t find it difficult but acknowledged that several viable prospects emerged. \u201cSeveral different types of people could be successful as associate dean, but passion for the work, enjoyment of high school students and a boarding environment and flexibility given the role\u2019s demands are all important,\u201d Weatherspoon said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Regarding this role of \u201chome\u201d that the OMSA takes on, senior and student proctor in the office Kelvin Green explained that for him, it\u2019s about being able to go into the office and speak with the dean and interns and ask them questions about life in general or about things on campus. \u201cThey\u2019re always there to listen and to talk and to make you feel like this place is your home and create that comfortable space,\u201d he said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Green believes it\u2019s important for faculty, administrators and students alike to really appreciate the office\u2019s services, which are always working to make Exeter a more inclusive space. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Another member of the search committee was International Student Coordinator Jennifer Smith, who works in the OMSA. For several years, she has worked in diversity and international education, which included participating in similar searches at other institutions. She agreed with Weatherspoon and Myers, as she also looked for individuals who have \u201cpassionate experience in social justice, equity and diversity work\u201d and could share those passions on campus. She also thought it would be important to have a person who could relate to and work with the entire Exeter community. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A member of the International Student Alliance, upper Pedro Sanson added that the OMSA is a \u201cgreat office\u201d that aids many affinity groups and clubs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI am constantly in the OMSA with Ms. Smith, the International Coordinator, to plan events and activities. It is a great support for international students.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Green also stressed the importance of adding a position in the OMSA. \u201cI think that dean Salcedo is so dedicated and devoted to so many causes on campus that it is really hard for her to do everything to the extent that she wants,\u201d he said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He said that the additional person will allow the office to increase the breadth of their activities. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Smith said that when the committee came together to discuss the finalists, they all shared similar opinions. She said the group had \u201cgreat energy\u201d and praised her colleagues for their devotion and thoughtfulness during the search. She found it difficult to think of a reason why this position would not be important. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe need to continue our work together as a community at Exeter around ideas of diversity, equity and social justice\u2014working to become fully competent and inclusive. Diversity is not a box we can check. We must continually think about these matters in all aspects of what we do,\u201d Smith said. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

Now, though, once they see this whitehead, they\u2019re going to equate me with the neon-colored polo-wearing boys I\u2019ve tried to distance myself from. I\u2019m a Vineyard Vines boy, not a baggy khakis with pockets boy.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Though Kuehn\u2019s girlfriend, fellow prep Love Interest, has outwardly been nonchalant about the entire ordeal, she quietly expressed concern when questioned by <i>The Exonian<\/i>. \u201cI\u2019ve been telling Pip that it\u2019s no biggie and that it\u2019s barely noticeable at all, only visible when you really look for it, but that\u2019s a lie. That\u2019s always a lie.\u201d Interest was unable to finish the rest of the interview due to the difficult circumstances of this event being the couple\u2019s second big hurdle in their relationship. (The first occurred on day two when Kuehn accused Interest of dabbing too much.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m really worried for them,\u201d one of Kuehn and Interest\u2019s friends said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been together for so long that they\u2019ve become the anchor of our prep class. Let\u2019s hope for their sake and ours too that this pimple goes away before Friday.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When the pimple was asked about when he was planning to heal, he said that he had every intention to stay and even planned to bring a couple friends out, too.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

        "content": "<p class=\"p1\">This week, I learned of something happy and hopeful that came out of this grueling election season. A Canadian Twitter account (named tellamericaitsgreat, @staygr8america) had nothing but positivity and joy to spread to their neighbors to the south; they took it upon themselves to remind America that we are perfectly good and that our somewhat unfriendly presidential race does not define who we are.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">In a tumultuous season filled with vicious personal attacks, mean banter, and general unpleasantness, seeing this not-so-little Twitter account spurting forth cheerful messages made me smile. Finally, something to cheer us up as we look at inconsistent polls and angry protestors! The message that our friends to the north were trying to get to wasn\u2019t wrong; America truly is a great country founded upon great values, and it is currently an incredible example of how inclusive and opportunity-filled a country can be.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2 pullquote\">Yet I believe that they were wrong in one big sense; this election <i>does <\/i>reflect badly upon the United States.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Yet I believe that they were wrong in one big sense; this election <i>does <\/i>reflect badly upon the United States. This election does show the world that sometimes, even the leaders of thoughtful democracy can be caught flat-footed. It shows that the American people can be swayed incredibly-so by bigotry and fear. To be perfectly blunt, it shows how we can mess up and put two people whom we really don\u2019t like on the ballot.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">American democracy finds it roots in Greece and France; from Cleisthenes to Montesquieu, it has never been one big idea. Instead, our democracy is (for all intents and purposes) just layers upon layers of ideas of different people and groups. Because of this, we have always been a model for the rest of the world. Even more importantly, we have always been the role models for those who want to improve their own democracies.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Does this election correlate to that? Not one bit. Instead of images of incredible, passionate debates, we have weird mud-slinging popularity contests. Instead of reasonable discussion between supporters, we have unruly shouting and yelling. Instead of anticipating, hopeful voters, we have indifferent and begrudging ones.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Sadly, voters have done a poor job of shaping this election. A poll taken during the summer showed that a measly 23 percent of voters were excited for the upcoming election (not to say they weren\u2019t interested\u2014a similar poll showed 65 percent were). This lack of excitement is, to be fair, understandable. Very few people who I have met are adamant about Trump or adamant about Hillary; in fact, most tell me up front that they are only going with the lesser of two evils. That is exactly what a presidential race should NOT boil down to. The two candidates voters select should be qualified, supported and most importantly well liked. Unfortunately, that isn\u2019t the case; 54 percent of voters view Hillary negatively and that 58 percent view Trump negatively.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">This all boils down to one big question; how could those two ever make it so far? How could our democracy have fallen short the one time we needed it most? I myself don\u2019t know how to answer this question. It probably has to do with the impulsive nature within all of us\u2014choosing the most appealing candidate at the time without proper research can lead to unwanted decisions and in the long run, unwanted consequences. Or maybe it has to do with smooth talking to further one\u2019s reputation and fear mongering to scare Americans into a vote. Regardless, it\u2019s definitely something not too good. And without any doubt, next time round, voters should be more informed and more knowledgeable instead of going with the candidate who shouts the loudest or whispers the sweetest.<\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

This leaves many students feeling like they cannot fully celebrate the impending demolition by Andover. Nevertheless, a group of administrative members and faculty have determined the perfect replacement for the bonfire: 12 lesser fires. To also alleviate any safety issues due to lack of lighting, these smaller blazes will be held at 4:21 p.m., though they may begin sooner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The bonfire\u2019s resemblance to cult activities has been cause for concern in the past. \u201cI\u2019m excited for the mini fires,\u201d stated lower Lylah Lemmons. \u201cThe giant fire mixed with the chanting really brought me back to my childhood that I do not want to relive.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Still, there are students who will miss the cult-like feel that the bonfire brings. \u201cI\u2019m not a part of crew,\u201d said sane senior Sally Simpson. \u201cThis is the only chance for me to feel like I belong somewhere. A series of fires instead of one giant fire will splinter the community. We\u2019ll all be divided, devoting ourselves to our respective fires. What if in one group they\u2019re making jokes? Sharing Snapchat usernames? I don\u2019t want to miss the action!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Others are incredibly worried that the smaller fires will not adequately warm Cilley. \u201cFew people know this,\u201d informed a six-year resident of Cilley, \u201cbut Cilley does not receive heating like all the other dorms. The bonfire is supposed to sustain us for the entire year. Now we will be freezing throughout the entire winter. Just like everyone had hoped.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Experienced pyro and senior RC McShane expressed his self-centered, senior-fall, college-apps-are-due-so-soon mindset on the coming conflagration. \u201cWhile I\u2019m disappointed in the lack of a singular fire, I think this is an awesome opportunity for the school to open this up as an opportunity for seniors to improve their college apps. These could be senior-run activities, and could be used as fluff to fill up that last extracurricular space on the Common App,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The bonfire was not available for comment.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

        "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Before the sun rose last Saturday morning, student athletes were already out of their beds and getting ready to take the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test (PSAT). After nearly three hours of slouching at a desk while reading and bubbling in answers, varsity and junior varsity teams headed off to their games in the afternoon at Northfield Mount Hermon School.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Nearly all of the sports teams had to alter their game times to allow uppers and lowers to take the PSAT. Boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 cross country and soccer rescheduled their Saturday events as well as girls\u2019 field hockey and volleyball. Unlike last year\u2019s PSAT, which was scheduled on a no-class Wednesday, the school could only administer the test at Exeter High School last Saturday. Although the teams were given accommodations in the form of an earlier testing hour, many students felt that their potential success in both academic and athletic performance that day were hindered by the fatigue presented by the intense PSAT schedule.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cWe found it hard to keep a positive attitude when things didn\u2019t go well, and overall, we just played at a slower pace.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Girls\u2019 varsity volleyball lost for the second time this season with a score of 1-3. Upper Bridgette Han explained that since uppers and lowers make up 11 out of 17 players on the team, many of the girls felt exhausted even before they started their game. Han got over eight hours of sleep and woke up at 5:30 a.m., but by the time she got on the bus to depart for NMH, she felt tired out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Upper and fellow girls\u2019 varsity volleyball player Molly O\u2019Day agreed with Han and noted that it \u201cabsolutely\u201d affected the game. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe found it hard to keep a positive attitude when things didn\u2019t go well, and overall, we just played at a slower pace,\u201d she said. Although inconvenient, she said that Saturday morning seemed to be the only time to take the test with the schedule presented. \u201cI wonder why we didn\u2019t take them Wednesday like last year,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Many of the athletes had trouble concentrating during their games because of the stressful situation of getting up earlier than a usual game day. Upper and junior varsity field hockey player Victoria Glidden slept for about six hours before the test. Although the team won 2-0 against NMH, she explained that she definitely felt tired during both her game and the test. She also noticed that many of her teammates were as exhausted as she was while playing.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>She thought that the game should have been rescheduled, but NMH hosted their family weekend this past week. \u201cThere weren\u2019t even any families watching us, so at least from a JV perspective we did not need to be playing,\u201d Glidden said. She felt that the stress was not really worth it, but the team\u2019s win worked out in the end.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Despite the setbacks of an early start to the day, both the varsity and junior varsity girls\u2019 cross country teams did well against NMH. Head coach Gwyn Coogan was proud of the girls\u2019 success, and from what she saw, she did not feel that the aftermath of the PSAT negatively affected the runners. \u201cThe team did great at NMH. I did not really notice if anyone was extremely tired because of the test,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lower and boys\u2019 cross country runner Charlie Neuhaus felt that the test had not affected his performance at NMH. Lower and girls\u2019 cross country runner Gabby Allen felt \u201cmentally tired at the meet,\u201d but she said that it only bothered her minimally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Although boys\u2019 junior varsity soccer had a game at Exeter High School the afternoon prior that did not greatly affect their night before the test, players on the varsity football team expected themselves to be too tired the next day to get up for the test at 7:30 a.m. Their evening game at Suffield Academy and a five-hour round-trip drive caused the team to arrive back on campus at around 1 a.m. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Upper Liam Luddington planned to get up the next morning but decided not to. After feeling exhausted from the day before, he felt that he needed to rest instead of repeating a standardized test. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was worth losing the sleep and messing up the rest of my weekend to take a test I had already taken,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Upper Abel Ngala had a similar experience to Luddington\u2019s. The most sleep they could have gotten was five hours. Ngala did not wake up to take the test and slept through it. He explained that he expected this to happen to him, saying that he \u201cneeded a miracle\u201d for him to get up on time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The exhausted athletes hoped that in future years, students would not have to face these issues of sleep deprivation and be forced to choose to prioritize academics or athletics. Although Han felt pressure from the PSAT and the game, she said that she was more anxious about the test and wanted to do her best because the PSAT \u201ccommenced the beginning to more standardized testing [uppers] will face throughout the year.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

        "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As a prep, I dreamt of the day that I would be granted the privilege of wearing the red and gray tartan kilts on E\/a. Although I wasn\u2019t particularly fond of the print itself, the idea it embodied was tantalizing. To be granted the kilt would mean that I made it through the difficult transition and awkward fumbling of prep year, the more difficult workload of lower year, the infamous workload of the 333 history sequence and upper spring and the horrors of senior fall. It would serve as a mark of camaraderie between me and my fellow four-years and symbolize the unique experience we\u2019d all shared after spending nearly a quarter of our lives together. It disappoints me that members of our community would want to strip four-years of this beloved tradition. The kilts do not indicate that the four-years are better than other seniors in any way. They simply acknowledge the unique impact that being at Exeter for four years has on students here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Four-year students at Exeter have a fundamentally different experience from other students. That\u2019s not to invalidate the careers of three-year, two-year or one-year students. Exeter is life-changing, and all students feel that effect and will be impacted by the culture and environment fostered here regardless of how many years they spend here. Spending four whole years here is certainly difficult, and being a new lower, new upper, new senior or postgraduate all have their difficulties. Nevertheless, the four-year experience is not the same as the three-year, two-year or one-year experience. It\u2019s silly not to acknowledge that and acknowledging that doesn\u2019t mean that the four-year experience is any better or any worse than those of other students.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2 pullquote\">Four-year students at Exeter have a fundamentally different experience from other students.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Plenty of things that we do on this campus are exclusive in arbitrary ways. Why is the tradition of kilts contested, while it\u2019s acceptable to have all four years pose for a picture, without having a three-year, two-year or one-year picture? If having only four years wear kilts at E\/a damages the unity felt in this community and drives people apart, wouldn\u2019t this picture apparently have the same effect? Dorms host exclusive events, requiring invitations for non-members. Should we abolish dorm teas too, to make those who don\u2019t get invited to any not feel marginalized by the event hosted with school funding? Yes, letting some people wear kilts provides a visual marker distinguishing four-year seniors from other students but, non-four-years are not scarred or emotionally damaged by being unable to wear a skirt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Observing the discussion around kilts, it seems to me that the only students who feel strongly about this tradition are those who wish to continue the tradition of four years wearing them. Not being able to wear a kilt is not damaging to non-four years in any fundamental way, but for many four years they hold a sentimental significance. It holds so much meaning to many four years. Is it really so awful to let us have this one thing? As many campus traditions have fallen to the wayside or changed recently, it\u2019s heartbreaking that four-year kilts may also no longer be a reality for my senior year. This tradition brings more joy to the campus than it hurts anyone. Most students either are in favor of it, or are indifferent. Let four-years have this one thing and feel the glory of having made it through four-years to finally become one of the seniors that we all looked up to as preps.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

        "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Peer Tutoring, an invaluable resource for students, brings together Exonians of all grades to take part in one of the most non sibi activities offered on campus: helping each other to learn. It meets five nights per week in the Academic Support Center, on the third floor of the Phelps Academy Center. There, from 7-9 p.m. on Sunday through Thursday nights, you will find students sitting in groups of two and three, quizzing each other on vocabulary or working out difficult math problems. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Academic Support Counselor Pamela Parris started the peer tutoring system and now supervises it every evening it meets. Her dedication has cultivated the group into the thriving program that it is today, and she encourages every student to become involved. \u201cPlease give it a try! I think you\u2019ll find it\u2019s a very friendly atmosphere,\u201d Parris said, also emphasizing the importance of soliciting help. \u201cEveryone needs help to get through Exeter\u2014and life\u2014so it\u2019s a crucial skill to determine when you need help and where to find it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cPeer tutoring has proved to be invaluable to my academic career at Exeter.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Peer tutors said that the most sought-after subjects are physics and math; however, discussing a complex biology reading with a tutor, or having \u201canother set of eyes\u201d look over an English paper can be very beneficial for students as well. \u201cI can say that peer tutoring certainly made a difference in my learning when I struggled with physics prep year,\u201d senior Daniela Nemirovsky, who now serves as a Head Peer Tutor. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Upper Kaleigh Conte also spoke highly of the group\u2019s services. \u201cPeer tutoring has proved to be invaluable to my academic career at Exeter,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve learned how to, and where to get help when I need it. Ms. Parris has helped me so much, and everyone should have a chance to meet her!\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Although some students may feel that seeking help shows weakness, Parris considers it to be a wise decision. \u201cWe really encourage students to seek help,\u201d she said. \u201cIt actually shows you\u2019re strong and mature.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Additionally, Parris wants students to know that giving and receiving help are not mutually exclusive, because each student has different strengths and weaknesses. \u201cOne of the best aspects of peer tutoring is that many students both give and get help while they\u2019re here,\u201d she said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Nemirovsky believes that the value of peer tutoring can be found in its student-to-student interaction. The club presents an informal and non-judgemental atmosphere that makes it easy for students to come whenever they need help. Nemirovsky noted that this kind of environment can be difficult to find in study groups or when meeting with teachers which, as a result, discourages students from asking the necessary questions for attaining a proper understanding of the material. Upper Sofia Yoon said, \u201cA lot of people prefer to get help from a peer tutor because the tutors themselves had the same experience, so they understand a lot about the course and the process of thinking.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s important to realize that peer tutors have often encountered similar experiences in terms of workload and the type of assignments that certain courses require. Thus, the learning experience becomes much more collaborative and personalized, which has often showed drastic improvement for students grappling with a topic of study. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With that being said, peer tutoring oftentimes also benefits the tutor. \u201cAs a peer tutor I have learned to be more patient and to understand how to explain solutions to peers, not just at peer tutoring, but also in class. This has made me a more valuable participant around the Harkness table,\u201d Nemirovsky said. Additionally, when tutors are forced to recall material and teach it to someone else, the process helps reinforce one\u2019s own understanding of the topic. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Whether you\u2019re helping, receiving help or just finishing some homework in the peer tutoring environment, every student familiar with the kind and welcoming atmosphere of the club considers it to reflect the values Exeter holds most dear: devotion to helping others and devotion to learning. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Parris said that her favorite moments are when soon-to-graduate tutors come to her and say that peer tutoring helped them to see education as a real career possibility. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI say \u2018hooray,\u2019 since education is the most rewarding field there is, and, I\u2019ll add, super non-sibi,\u201d Parris said. \u201cIt may not mean being a classroom teacher or professor; there are many ways to be an educator.\u201d Evidently, peer tutoring helps create community-minded Exonians with a passion for teaching others.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

        "content": "<p class=\"p1\">Unbeknownst to the majority of Exonians, renovations have been occurring atop the library, Wetherell, Phillips Hall and the playhouse outside of Hoyt. With family weekend approaching, the demand for local helicopter landing pads has increased, leading the administration to put in work orders for their construction on campus.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The renovations have been a source of annoyance and peril for faculty. \u201cIt was bad enough walking up five flights of stairs to get to my classroom,\u201d stated a German instructor on the top of Phillips Hall. \u201cWhen the construction started, all the drilling drowned out my German heavy metal. How am I supposed to embrace German culture when I can\u2019t distinguish between the hammering on the roof and the hammering in the music?\u201d When asked about the ceiling tile that fell as a result of the renovation and ultimately gave a student a concussion, the German teacher responded, \u201cOh, yes. His screams also blended in with my music.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Overall, students are not pleased with this development. \u201cFirst of all, I don\u2019t want people to know that my parents can afford a helicopter. The rich are a real minority here,\u201d said anonymous student Tim Smith. \u201cSecond of all, my parents have already done too much. Not only do they constantly email my adviser, but they FaceTime my friends every Tuesday night.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tim Smith\u2019s friends were available for comment. \u201cYeah, Tim\u2019s parents are great. They pay us to tell them if Tim\u2019s doing his homework, whether he works out, and whether or not he\u2019s eating his collard greens.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Families, on the other hand, are ecstatic about the change. \u201cNow I can come up every weekend!\u201d enthused parent Megan Campbell. Campbell is not only the president of her kids\u2019 PTA, but also the president of her nieces\u2019 and nephews\u2019 PTA, her dog-groomer\u2019s kids\u2019 PTA and Malia and Sasha Obama\u2019s PTA. \u201cI\u2019m sure that my respective child will be so happy to have me around more often!\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">While the reactions to the construction of helicopter pads are mixed, it\u2019s the families who get the final say. As Thomas Jefferson once said, \u201cAt Phillips Exeter Academy, it\u2019s the parents who pay the tuition, not the students.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

        "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Six members of the class of 2020 have successfully advanced to the next round of student council representative elections for the position of prep class representative, or \u201cprep rep.\u201d Ayush Noori, Benjamin Cai, Mai Hoang, Billy Menken, William Park and Samuel Lew have all fulfilled the requirements to officially run to be a prep rep. Members of the prep class will vote for three representatives on Tuesday, Oct. 25. The candidates have until then to campaign.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Those who were officially designated as candidates for prep rep are enthusiastic upon their appointment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lew was excited to potentially represent his class and to give them a smooth tenure at the Academy.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>\u201cI hope to be the voice for our class of 2020. I know that all the preps have different issues that the preps face, so I want to be the one to address these issues and fix [them],\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The prep rep nomination process hit some roadblocks before a sufficient number of the class of 2020 passed the candidacy requirements. The original deadline for candidacy was Oct. 11, but only one candidate, Ayush Noori, fulfilled the requirements at that date. Several other students failed to gather enough signatures and\/or failed to submit a statement. To be eligible to run, potential candidates for prep rep had to collect signatures from 93 members of the class of 2020 and submit a candidacy statement to the Student Council elections committee. Members of the class of 2020 were then given another week to meet the standards of eligibility. Noori was allowed to begin campaigning a week before the other candidates as a reward. Typically, candidates are only allowed to begin campaigning when all students in the running are verified as candidates. In addition, the signing sheets for certain students were confiscated during an assembly, a practice that is not allowed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cI personally had a great time being prep rep. It\u2019s a great chance to get to know all your fellow classmates, try your hand at organizing events and get to know how StuCo works.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">All prep rep candidates may now begin campaigning. They have one week to garner support through posters, social media or whatever other medium they choose, so long as they stay within a budget of $20.16.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The number of candidates for prep rep is much lower than it has been in previous years. Typically, anywhere from 15 to 20 candidates run for the position. Elections committee co-head and senior Kelly Lew attributes this shift and the inability of the class of 2020 to raise enough eligible candidates in the typical week-long period to a decline in popularity of the prep rep position. She felt that not enough members of the class took the role seriously, and thus didn\u2019t attempt to fulfill the eligibility requirements. \u201cApparently, preps didn\u2019t feel inclined to run, because they view the position as lame and \u2018not cool,\u2019\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Prep Benjamin Wright noticed a similar trend among his class. \u201cI feel like not that many people express interest in the prep reps,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In general, members of the class seemed to have little regard for the position and many did not think to run. \u201cTo be honest, I gave no thought into whoever\u2019s paper I sign because I think it\u2019ll probably be inconsequential anyways,\u201d prep Jack Liu said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lew was upset by the idea that the position of prep rep was not worth pursuing. \u201cI am very frustrated with the preps and their lack of motivation,\u201d Lew said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Some members of the prep class seemed to be unaware of what the position entails. \u201cI honestly have no expectations in our prep reps. I don\u2019t know what prep reps are supposed to do,\u201d prep Andrew Sun said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Prep Matthew Wabunoha agreed. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the purposes of prep reps are,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">On the other hand, upper Pradyumn Dayal, who served as the representative for his prep class, felt that there was value in serving as a prep rep and that they are able to help members of their class. \u201cI personally had a great time being prep rep. It\u2019s a great chance to get to know all your fellow classmates, try your hand at organizing events and get to know how StuCo works,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Upper Jackson Parell, secretary of the Student Council, made clear that the position of prep rep was important to Student Council and to the prep class. \u201cThey are supposed to represent the voice of the prep class. Without them we do not have a full representative council,\u201d he said. He further emphasized the important role prep reps play in uniting their class in their first year at the Academy. \u201cThey also plan events for the prep class which are essential in bringing the class together,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

        "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">During the fall Exeter vs. Andover (E\/a) games in past years, four year seniors proudly wore their red tartan kilts, passed down from each senior class to the next. It has been a long tradition at both Andover and Exeter for four year seniors to wear kilts in their school colors at fall E\/a. This tradition fell into jeopardy recently, prompting discussion in Student Council.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The conversation was prompted when a deficit in the number of kilts was brought to light. Student Council was charged with deciding whether to provide all seniors with kilts, or to not have enough kilts for all four-year seniors, as they were 60 kilts short of having enough for all the four-year seniors. The school wouldn\u2019t pay for kilts unless they would be provided to the whole class. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201c[The administration] see kilts for only four year seniors as discriminatory,\u201d senior and Student Council President Matthew Robbins said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cI believe it is a nice token that helps connect the four-year seniors.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When boxes of additional kilts were found, the problem was solved. However, students began to question whether the kilt tradition is exclusive or not. The discussion has spilled over from Student Council into the community Facebook forum \u201cBus Ride.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Many in the community are supportive of maintaining the kilt tradition. They believe that it unites four-year seniors and serves as a symbol of the unique experience they have, rather than isolating them from the rest of their class. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great thing that only four-year seniors get the kilts,\u201d Robbins said. \u201cIt is a great unifying thing for four-year seniors and it keeps in place a good tradition.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Joel Lotzkar, the senior class president, voiced a similar opinion: \u201cI am in full support of four year seniors receiving kilts. It is a longstanding tradition that should be continued,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lotzkar went on to emphasize the unifying power of the kilts, saying, \u201cI believe it is a nice token that helps connect the four-year seniors. It is great that we have enough kilts for all the four-year seniors!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Other members of the community feel that the tradition of the kilts ultimately excludes more than they bring people together. Lower Junze Ye felt that the custom sidelined all other seniors and invalidated their experiences. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cEven though I will be a four year senior, I still feel that it\u2019s marginalizing other non-four-year-seniors,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Upper Greg Miller felt that the tradition was clearly discriminatory. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how you can deny someone something based on something as arbitrary as year entering and not call that discrimination.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">StuCo advisor and health instructor Carol Cahalane disagreed with the council\u2019s decision to not accept additional funding from the school in exchange for providing kilts to all seniors. \u201cI understand why the council has made the decision that they have, but I disagree.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">She felt that the tradition contradicted the unifying spirit of E\/a, and undermined the idea that all seniors, regardless of when they came to the Academy, can contribute positively to the community. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cAt a time when we are celebrating our unity and school spirit, it seems a funny time to be highlighting only some of our seniors, as they all bring something special to our school,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Others in the community were indifferent towards the tradition and felt that rules dictating who can and cannot wear kilts were inconsequential. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Upper Ali Hassani said, \u201cI don\u2019t see a problem with four-year student wearing kilts. I think they\u2019re ugly. Even if I were [a four-year student] I probably wouldn\u2019t wear one.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Only four-year seniors will be sporting the traditional red and gray kilts this E\/a, but the future of the longstanding custom remains in question. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

        "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Exeter Fire Department (EFD) has placed the Town of Exeter under a fire ban and prohibited the Academy from holding its traditional bonfire at this year\u2019s Fall Exeter\/Andover (E\/a) Pep Rally due to the ongoing drought in southern New Hampshire,. In light of the extreme dry conditions, all fire permits have been revoked and no new ones will be issued until conditions improve, according to Brian Comeau, Chief of the EFD and Town Forest Warden.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Comeau, who is responsible for issuing fire permits to Exeter residents, explained that the permit for the Academy\u2019s annual bonfire is issued as a \u201cper-event type permit\u201d and lasts for only 24 hours. In past years, the bonfire has been cancelled because of weather conditions, including high winds that could result in the fire spread to other properties. In other cases, the EFD has made the last-minute decision based on wind speed to remain on-site with an engine to pump water from the Exeter River. Due to the removal of the dam in the river and the low water levels that have ensued, this is no longer a possibility.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cRemoval of the dam poses a number of problems for the Fire Department and the town,\u201d Comeau explained. \u201cTo maintain good fire protection and conserve water is a balancing act. Not issuing burning permits helps limit the possibility of accidental fires that use water resources.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Environmental Health and Safety Manager Tegan Vassillion drew attention to the dangers associated with having a bonfire, given these restricting factors. Noting the high risk of fire spread and the limited available resources to put the fire out in the case of emergency, Vassillion emphasized that \u201cthe decision to cancel the bonfire was made strictly for safety reasons.\u201d She said, \u201cAs much as we would all like to see the tradition continue this year, mother nature is not acting in our favor and the safety of the students and the community that we live in must come first.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cAs much as we would all like to see the tradition continue this year, mother nature is not acting in our favor and the safety of the students and the community that we live in must come first.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Nevertheless, many students have expressed disappointment following the decision. Senior Alex Rothstein explained that she will miss how the bonfire \u201cbrought our school together in warmth and in spirit\u2026 [A]fter being here for almost four years now, I\u2019m genuinely upset I can\u2019t end my E\/a fall tradition with the bonfire.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lower Kate Denny described the bonfire as the best part of the pep rally. \u201cWe\u2019re all together and it\u2019s kind of just a wonderful moment,\u201d she said. Similarly, upper Michael Bamah felt that the bonfire helped bring the community together and that without it, \u201cthat same community aspect won\u2019t be here this year.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Upper Renaud recalled the bonfire to be \u201ca big school spirit booster,\u201d and expressed concern that school spirit might be diminished this year as a result. \u201c[T]here\u2019s something special about a huge fire and tons of people surrounding it&#8230;I\u2019m very disappointed that it won\u2019t be happening,\u201d he said. However, other students maintained greater optimism. Though senior Bonnie LaBont\u00e9 felt \u201csort of disappointed,\u201d she pointed out that E\/a is such a fun time already that the absence of the bonfire would take little away from the overall experience. \u201cAs much as I love the bonfire, not much happens at it so I don\u2019t think it will really affect the pep rally,\u201d she said. Like LaBont\u00e9, senior Graham Rutledge explained that when people are cheering at games the following day, the lack of a bonfire would be \u201cthe last things on their minds.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lower Tara Weil recognized the importance of prioritizing student safety and felt that if the absence of a bonfire posed a great threat to school spirit, it would be more indicative of the school\u2019s culture in general. \u201cIf your school pride can be threatened by not having a bonfire then there\u2019s an issue,\u201d she said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Though senior Bella Edo, a co-head of Student Council\u2019s Recreation Committee, recognized that the lack of a bonfire will feel odd, she revealed that her committee is in the early stages of<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>developing ideas for other events to replace the bonfire. She suggested that one such possibility could be a powderpuff football game, although the idea has not yet been brought to Student Council. \u201cIt might be new and exciting enough to take people\u2019s minds off of [the absence of] the bonfire,\u201d Edo said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Even amidst their varying degrees of disappointment, most students recognized that the decision was both logical and necessary. Though senior Yoshiko Lynch felt that not having a bonfire \u201cruins the tradition,\u201d she acknowledged the good in saving water and preventing a forest fire. Upper Anzi DeBenedetto also believed that the school should not waste water, especially \u201cif it wants to be a good neighbor to the town of Exeter.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Though Vassillion reserved hope that a significant amount of rainfall in the next month could reverse the decision, she recognized that \u201cthe chances of this happening are slim.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Campus Safety will work closely with the EFD to continue monitoring the situation, but Comeau noted that, with the extreme drought conditions that Exeter has experienced, the fire ban could be in effect well into the spring.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

        "title_plain": "Exonian Explores Freedom of Press At The Academy",
        "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In light of recent administrative directives restricting <i>The Exonian<\/i> from publishing certain content, the editors and faculty advisers of the newspaper have grappled with their understanding of freedom of press within a private high school environment. <i>The Exonian<\/i> staff have sought to maintain the uncensored status of the paper and uphold their standards of free press as a community responsibility, while ensuring that their content does not compromise student safety and upholds strong journalistic integrity. To this end, the editors have worked with the paper\u2019s advisers and members of the administration to address questions of whether the public\u2019s right to know certain information outweighs the potential damage it could cause. The Executive Board is also in the process of developing a set of guidelines for its relationship with the administration in a way that preserves <i>The Exonian<\/i>\u2019s mission of free press.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Like all student-run publications on campus, <i>The Exonian<\/i> is subject to both its bylaws and the Publication Guidelines outlined in the E-Book. These guidelines, drafted by the Publications Committee about 10 years ago, emphasize that the Academy depends on the \u201cfree expression of ideas and has a standing presumption in its favor,\u201d but that it is obligated to prevent the \u201cpublication of inappropriate or harmful content, including material that humiliates or disparages individuals or groups.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The E-Book guidelines detail the role of the adviser within a publication, specifically stating that, while the authority to prevent publication of objectionable material ultimately rests with the adviser, the exercise of such authority ought to be a last resort. <i>The Exonian<\/i>\u2019s bylaws, however, contradict this guideline: The faculty adviser is described as an instructor and a mentor, not a censor, and the editor-in-chief reserves final say on all editorial decisions. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>The Exonian<\/i> bylaw\u2019s also assert that the newspaper is not subject to prior review, prior restraint, or censorship, and that \u201cstaff members claim a broad right to report and editorialize about all issues, including unpopular or controversial ones.\u201d However, recent cases of sexual misconduct at Exeter and their subsequent media coverage have stirred administrative concerns about the potential harm that could be caused by publishing certain sensitive material in <i>The Exonian<\/i>\u2014<i>The Exonian<\/i> board was told that it could not cover a recent lawsuit against the Academy involving a current student, and that it could not publish a letter from an alumnus in which specific members of the administration were disparaged. In turn, these measures have raised questions regarding the First Amendment rights of private school students, as well as the supposed uncensored status of <i>The Exonian<\/i>. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cWe at Exeter believe in freedom of speech\u2014which means we believe also in the obligation to respect that right by using it responsibly.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As a private institution, the Academy is not subject to the First Amendment the way that the government is, so it has the ability to censor content. In a situation where something is published that puts someone at harm or is libelous, an outside party gains the grounds to sue Exeter, arguing that the Academy could have exercised censorship. However, the academic integrity of the school relies on free and honest discourse, and, in support of this mission, Principal Lisa MacFarlane stated, \u201cWe at Exeter believe in freedom of speech\u2014which means we believe also in the obligation to respect that right by using it responsibly.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While senior Philip Kuhn, <i>The Exonian<\/i>\u2019s editor-in-chief, acknowledged both the Academy\u2019s concerns surrounding the two cancelled pieces and the school\u2019s legal right to prohibit content, he felt the administration could have approached the situation without directly dictating the newspaper\u2019s content.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe Academy should have approached this situation as an open-dialogue. If they had brought their concerns about the pieces to us and explained any details without directly telling us not to run them, I would fully trust our ability to make the right journalistic decision, while still considering student safety,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In a meeting with Assistant Principal Ron Kim and Chief Financial Officer David Hanson last week, both the advisers and several members of <i>The Exonian<\/i> discussed how the administration and <i>The Exonian<\/i> could better navigate similar situations in the future. Kuhn felt that a consensus was reached that addressed his concerns while also acknowledging <i>The Exonian<\/i>\u2019s role to consider student safety and issues the administration may bring forth. <i>The Exonian<\/i> is currently working on drafting an amendment to their bylaws that better details to future boards of <i>The Exonian<\/i> the relationship between the administration and editors. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In regards to the legality of the situation, history instructor Michael Golay, a former adviser of the newspaper, recognized that a cautious reading of the law might suggest that students don\u2019t have First Amendment rights. \u201cBut to apply that reading to Exeter sets a pretty low bar. We ought to aim higher. We always have aimed higher. The students deserve the best possible protections for freedom of expression.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While history instructor and former <i>Exonian<\/i> adviser Bill Jordan acknowledged that the legal rights to free expression are not always clear for private school students, he argued that without freedom of speech, there is no academic integrity to an institution. \u201cExeter may not be bound legally by the First Amendment, but ethically it is,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there were ever an institution that should stand up for the principle of freedom of expression, it is Exeter. And if we didn\u2019t, I would feel really disillusioned.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Likewise, senior and news editor Henrietta Reily pointed out that it is in the best interest of the school, particularly in the long term, to permit <i>The Exonian<\/i> to be as uncensored as possible. This, she believed, will demonstrate that the Academy \u201cfosters free thought and encourages young journalists to learn by doing without constantly being manipulated or quieted.\u201d Reily continued, observing that \u201cit would look like pretty poor posturing, I think, if we only published flippant, pro-Academy, happy articles. No one would be able to take that seriously.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Nevertheless, Jordan acknowledged that there will always be limitations on the freedom of press within a school newspaper, but that it is up to the school to determine those limitations. Referencing organizations such as the Student Press Law Center and Journalism Educators Association, which advocate for students to have the final say in the content of student newspapers, Jordan argued that prior restraint places too much power in the censors. \u201cIt allows them to kill ideas before they see the light of day,\u201d he continued. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, Golay considered it very rare for the administration to exercise prior restraint. During his eight years as adviser to <i>The Exonian<\/i>, \u201cit never happened once so it\u2019s unusual, highly unusual.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Interim co-Directors of Student Wellbeing Tina Sciocchetti and Jane Stapleton have worked with <i>The Exonian<\/i> to preserve this commitment to freedom of expression, while recommending that its coverage of sensitive topics involving sexual misconduct should not be directed at specific cases and specific people. \u201cWe feel strongly that singling out specific students on campus who are affected by sexual assault is harmful,\u201d Sciocchetti said. \u201cWe ask <i>Exonian<\/i> writers to put themselves in the place of the students being written about and ask themselves, how would it feel to be written about in that manner?\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Noting the importance of protecting the wellbeing of students on campus, Reily explained that if an article were to have the potential to make a student feel attacked or uncomfortable, it would most likely not be worth publishing, \u201csimply because we all live together in such a small, closed community.\u201d She felt that in situations like these, administrators or advisers tend to \u201cstep in and ask us not to publish a piece.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, Golay questioned whether good journalism would in fact cost a student\u2019s well-being. \u201cI think there\u2019s a way of doing stories that would actually be positive and affirmative &#8230; good journalism in my view is usually a force for good,\u201d he said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With this in mind, many members of <i>The Exonian<\/i> staff share a view that efforts should be directed towards instilling good journalistic practices, rather than censoring content. According to Jordan, if writers are taught about ethical journalism and laws involving libel and invasion of privacy, they will be responsible in their reporting. \u201cI have always thought that one of the most impressive things about Exeter is the amount of faith we put in the students. I think that our students tend to be responsible because we respect them enough to give them responsibility,\u201d he said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In keeping with this objective, English instructor Erica Plouffe Lazure, an adviser to <i>The Exonian<\/i>, stressed that her role is to support writers and editors in making difficult decisions and to help make the newspaper the best it can be. While this often does include reading parts of the paper before it goes to print, she does not consider this censorship, but rather a way to ensure that students are exercising freedom of press with responsibility and in accordance with E-Book policy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cAnd, of course, to minimize typos and make sure we are putting out the best newspaper possible,\u201d she added. In <i>The Exonian<\/i> bylaws, the adviser is clearly stated to not be an agent of the school administration, but rather a source of advice and guidance to the editors. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While MacFarlane pointed out that not every paper will get it right all the time, she commended the efforts of <i>The Exonian<\/i> to balance rights and responsibilities when facing questions of how to best inform readers, promote thoughtful discussion and represent the facts fairly and accurately. \u201cI trust, expect and believe that <i>The Exonian<\/i> struggles in the best Exeter way with these tough questions, and wants always to get it right,\u201d MacFarlane said.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

Well, put away your bag charms because 2016 is all about the removable bag straps. This trend started after Fendi (yes, Fendi again) introduced the removable \u201cStrap You\u201d bag straps in its Resort 2016 collection. After its release, the Fendi Strap You became an instant hit that other designer brands such as Rebecca Minkoff, Kate Spade and Valentino have release their own versions of. These straps normally have interesting colors and details on them; they will automatically change the appearance of your bag and make it stand out from the crowd. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Before, wearing white on white after Labor Day used to be a big fat <i>no<\/i> in the fashion world. However, nowadays, styling white on white during Fall and Winter has become widely accepted; it is actually quite trendy. The fabric and silhouette of your white clothes is really important when it comes to rocking white during the colder season. Instead of wearing linen and light cotton, go for heavier white materials such as denim, wool and cashmere. If you are afraid to wear all white, start off by pairing your white clothes with light neutral colors such as beige. Once you are comfortable with the light neutral and white pairing, then you might opt for the bold white on white pairing. Some popular white pieces that are currently fashion-forward and versatile are ruffled tops, long coats, turtlenecks, denim jeans\/jackets, culottes and ankle boots. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This week, <b>Mary Woo \u201917<\/b> channeled a grunge-chic look in her oversized army jacket, gray sweater, black ankle boots and black leather tote. <b>Molly Canfield \u201918<\/b> stood out in her purple body-con dress, fringed kimono and ankle boots. <b>Teddy Scott \u201918<\/b> channeled a preppy vibe with his light blue dress shirt, red shorts and boat shoes. <b>Wynter Tracey \u201919<\/b> paired an interesting navy blue police uniform inspired jacket with a striped t-shirt, jeans and a pair of Doc Martens. <b>Kate Denny \u201919<\/b> rocked a all black outfit. She paired an oversized t-shirt with leggings and finished her outfit with a unique hat and chunky heels. <b>Sebastian Bango \u201919<\/b> looked effortlessly cool in his oversized green bomber jacket, extended white t-shirt and white sneakers. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Earlier this week, Vetements, one of the most popular French designer\/street wear brand, held a garage sale in the outskirts of Seoul, South Korea. Since South Korea is one of the largest market for Vetements and its knockoffs, Demna Gvasalia the creative director of the brand, launched an \u201cOriginal Fake\u201d collection, intended to imitate knock-off Vetements pieces. When asked about his feelings towards knock-off, Guram Dvasalia told <i>W Magazine<\/i>, &#8220;I think it\u2019s good to see, because it means that you\u2019re relevant and that people want it. I just don\u2019t like when people try to sell fakes saying it\u2019s real. That\u2019s not right.&#8221; Despite being an all day event, all the items sold out in one hour (the most popular being the Vetements raincoat), a testament to the immense popularity of the brand. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Enjoy the wonderful weather and have a great weekend with your friends and family! <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Stay stylish, <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Connor &amp; Tanya <\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

        "title_plain": "Three Short  Films in Review",
        "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For viewers who want a single-standing film but cannot afford to spend two hours enjoying one, a Disney short film serves as an enjoyable five-minute production. A collection of short films is available on Netflix and other online sources. Although some of the films are tacky commercial fillers, many of the recent ones are excellent in all aspects such as story, music and animation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Little Matchgirl: 3 stars<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Based off of Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s original story from 1846, \u201cThe Little Matchgirl\u201d depicts the last moments of a young Russian girl\u2019s life as she struggles to sell matches in the snow. There is no dialogue or sound besides a segment of Alexander Borodin\u2019s String Quartet No. 2 in D Major in the background. Walt Disney Animation Studios usually does not create movies with no musical numbers, a love story or humor, and the decision to create a short film instead of a full length feature fit this story well. Although younger children may not understand the transitions of the girl\u2019s reality into fantasy, I found the film extremely bittersweet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Like most Disney short films, the animation is not the traditional two dimensional form of the full length features. The quality of animation and color transforms the viewer into the scene on the cold streets and the feast by the fire that she imagines as she lights her matches. It is a film worth taking the time to watch, but it is not one that warrants multiple viewings. It is a beautiful combination of visual and auditory components, but it is a downer compared to all of the other films a viewer could watch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Frozen Fever: 1 star<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Compared to other short films made by Disney, \u201cFrozen Fever\u201d was intolerable. Similarly to the movie\u2019s scene featuring Anna singing before her sister Elsa\u2019s coronation, this is a musical style film featuring Elsa\u2019s preparation for Anna\u2019s surprise birthday. The short film, released two years after the original movie, lacks the magical aspect of the animation from the first.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The misunderstood logic of Olaf\u2019s abilities could pass when there was a cute song featuring him, but this new concept of tiny snowmen who appear when Elsa sneezes makes no sense and does not contribute anything to the story. Elsa wears a green dress and conjures flowers in this film which is aggravatingly inconsistent. Most of the major concerns with this film involved were reflected in the tons of merchandise that Disney marketed and sold as \u201cnew\u201d Elsa, Anna and Olaf dolls. All in all, \u201cFrozen Fever\u201d is not an entertaining piece that provides any feelings of amazement that usually accompanies most Disney classics.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Feast: 4 stars<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cFeast\u201d tells the story of Winston, an adorable Boston Terrier, and his relationship with James, a person who accidentally drops a fry in front of Winston on the street. The most appealing aspect of this movie was the relatable connection between a loyal dog and human. Unlike most animated film that include talking and singing dogs, the animators created a character whom we can clearly envision in our own lives. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The story shows how the introduction of another person into a close friend\u2019s life can often feel like being pushed aside. Winston struggles with his jealousy, and when James ends up reverting into a sad and unmotivated person, Winston overcomes his personal issues and helps James\u2014a lesson that a parent would want to teach their child. By the end of the film, Winston welcomes more additions into his owner\u2019s life and they both end up being happy. If you enjoy animated dogs and appetizing food, \u201cFeast\u201d supplies comfort during hours when you should be doing work.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

The club hosts discussions of issues both on and off campus and is excited about its plans for this year. These plans include two \u201cVegFests,\u201d which are plant-based meals in Wetherell with music and tablecloths. This fall, VegFest will take place on Nov. 10 in Wetherell for dinner, so make sure to invite your friends if you are interested in trying out some delicious vegetarian options!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cOur diets and, specifically, the meat in them cause more greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, nitrous oxide and the like to spew into the atmosphere than either transportation or industry.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Along with the ethical reasons, there are also a lot of environmental reasons to try out a vegetarian meal. The Wall Street Journal estimates that producing just one quarter-pound hamburger requires 1300 gallons of water. The Scientific American states \u201cOur diets and, specifically, the meat in them cause more greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, nitrous oxide and the like to spew into the atmosphere than either transportation or industry.\u201d The animal agriculture industries waste huge quantities of water and produces greenhouse gases, so this meal will be saving the environment too. So bring your friends to VegFest to enjoy some delicious, animal-friendly, and eco-friendly dishes, such as a vegetarian shepherd\u2019s pie made with a soy crumble instead of meat and focaccia-style barbecue Gardeine pizza. Additionally, there will be artisan bread baskets on every table along with desserts such as Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s ice cream flavors, sorbet and possibly a chocolate avocado pudding. For drinks, we will be featuring a sparkling pomegranate punch fountain. Be sure to come early so that you can sample all the popular dishes before they run out, as it was a huge success last year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Animal Rights Club is also trying to schedule a visit to a local farm sanctuary called Live and Let Live, so that we can get a chance to interact with some animals such as cute pigs, cows, chickens and more. We are likely to go on a Sunday afternoon. If you are interested in going, please let us know so that we can give you more details about the trip.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Another one of Animal Rights Club\u2019s projects this year will be setting up a workshop for Climate Action Day. Last year, the club hosted a screening of the movie \u201cCowspiracy,\u201d which highlighted the environmental impact of the farm industry. The screening was followed by a panel discussion in which viewers could ask questions about the film and vegetarianism in general. This year, Animal Rights Club is seeking to host another informative workshop to educate the community on the impact livestock have on the environment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Of course, you do not have to be a vegetarian or vegan to come to the meetings or get involved. Animal Rights Club welcomes people from all backgrounds and welcomes discussion on issues that affect animals. If you are interested in getting involved, please contact one of the co-heads, Anna Clark \u201919 (acclark1@exeter.edu) or Emmett Shell \u201918 (eshell@exeter.edu) to be added to the email list and informed about any upcoming animal rights-related events. We hope to see you at one of our meetings soon!<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

Children in grades K-5 and Exonians gather Sundays from 2:30-3:30 p.m. in the fall and spring to celebrate the magic of Harry Potter and an afternoon of friendly competition. Nestled in the land between Phillips Hall and the Academy Center, Quidditch meetings must be approved by the Ministry of Magic. This means that broomsticks are not allowed, but the amount of energy that gathers every Sunday makes up for the lack of flying. And, if you see how fast some of the kids can run, you\u2019d be glad that they couldn\u2019t fly too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">&#8220;The best part of Quidditch is knowing that it\u2019s something that the kids look forward to and seeing that displayed whenever we play.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I, senior Majestic Terhune, am a co-head of Quidditch with Kids along with Miranda Derossi. I originally joined the club three years ago because two upperclassmen in my dorm were the co-heads and had urged me to attend at least one meeting. There had never been a point in my life in which I took a few days to read an entire Harry Potter book. I hadn\u2019t even sat through one movie. To top it off, I had about zero experience with children. Quidditch did not seem like a great match but, after one meeting, I knew that I had to return the next week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The best part of Quidditch is knowing that it\u2019s something that the kids look forward to and seeing that displayed whenever we play. It\u2019s not uncommon for a couple of the players show up in Gryffindor robes or bring a wand to show their friends, and sometimes those friends end up finding a time to meet later in the week. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Moreover, one boy was three when his older brother first started playing and now, after gaining a couple years and adding on a few inches, he\u2019s now old enough to rival his sibling. Hearing his giggle when someone finds him hiding behind a tree or seeing him run to hug his mother during a water break always turns into a highlight of my week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Overall, Quidditch is an easy and enjoyable way for you to involve yourself in the Exeter community and further understand your role within the neighborhood. The kids that attend look up to us and the parents wholly appreciate the time taken to spend an hour with their children, and it\u2019s in ESSO clubs like Quidditch where you further fathom the sense of community that you have the ability to foster.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To join the Quidditch email list or simply learn more about the ESSO club, contact Miranda at mderossi@exeter.edu or me at mterhune@exeter.edu. We\u2019ll see you and your friend when we meet next on Sunday, Oct. 30! <\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

        "title_plain": "Exonians Receive Free Flu Shots for the Coming Winter",
        "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Lamont Health and Wellness Center set up its annual Flu Clinic in Grainger Auditorium on Sunday, Oct. 9.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Every year it aims to keep students healthy for the coming flu season. Similar to last year, students lined up to receive the free shot during allocated times with their dorms. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">About 680 students took the flu shot on Sunday, which did not include those who received the shot prior to coming to Exeter or students who received the shot with their primary care physicians (PCPs). <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Associate Medical Director Benjamin Gardner stressed the importance of taking the flu shot. Although not foolproof, the purpose of the shots is to mitigate many effects of the flu, and the shots are highly effective. \u201cYou can occasionally feel a little bit off, but compared to the flu &#8230; the best description of the flu is like getting hit by a truck for five days,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cEven though I felt like it hurt more than other shots have in the past, the fact that it was so quick and hassle-free made up for any little problems for me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Director of Nursing Nancy Thompson agreed with Gardner\u2019s strong emphasis on flu shots. \u201cOnce you have [had the flu], you will never not get your flu shot again,\u201d she said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Although most students make a full recovery within five days, she mentioned that the intense work environment at Exeter makes having the flu more difficult. \u201cEspecially for Exonians, [being] out of commission for five days is not a possibility, it\u2019s not even an option,\u201d she said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Although the flu shot is estimated to be only 60 to 85 percent effective, Thompson believes it is better than not getting one at all. \u201cYou\u2019re not guaranteed immunity. However, if you were to get the flu, your symptoms are likely going to be a lot less severe. You probably won\u2019t have as high a fever and you\u2019re not going to feel as bad,\u201d she said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The only major change in this year\u2019s clinic was the absence of flu mists, or nasal spray vaccine, which is a less invasive way of vaccination through the nasal cavity. This was not based upon the decision of the medical center, however. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) did a study looking at the efficacy of that type of vaccine, and it was determined to be only about three percent effective, so they pulled it off the market,\u201d she said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Thompson also explained the necessity for students to take the shot annually because the type of flu and its strains change each year. Unlike other viruses, such as chickenpox, the flu is ever-changing, and a shot won\u2019t provide lifelong immunity. \u201cThe flu is not a one shot deal,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With the flu already circulating around New Hampshire, Thompson encourages all students to take the shot sooner rather than later. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt takes two weeks to develop immunity, which is why everybody has to come and get the flu shot,\u201d she said. She hopes enough Exonians will have taken the shot to protect those who have not, a term referred to as herd immunity. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to be healthy this winter,\u201d Thompson said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Most students have found the flu vaccination to be easily accessible, sanitary and efficient. Each dorm had an assigned time for residents to get the shot together, but senior Brian Choi said that \u201cpeople who missed their scheduled times also had plenty of time to receive their shots at the Health Center.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Since the assigned times were spread out throughout the day, most students found the process to be very efficient. Upper Noah Asch said he went to Grainger \u201caround 8 at night and I was in and out in no more than three minutes.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Students also mentioned the convenience of getting the flu vaccination on campus, as there are no other locations close by. Upper Maria Lee said she doesn\u2019t \u201chave to make an appointment somewhere else and find transportation to get there.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The flu shot was available for all students on campus, including faculty children and day students. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWithout the clinic, I would have had to go to Portsmouth to get the shot,\u201d Asch said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Although the flu clinic was convenient for all, students\u2019 opinions were divided on whether or not the flu shot was more painful compared to previous years. Upper Grace Khaner said, \u201cEven though I felt like it hurt more than other shots have in the past, the fact that it was so quick and hassle-free made up for any little problems for me.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Others said that the shot didn\u2019t seem to have much of a difference compared to other years. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cMy shoulder felt the same soreness as last year, but this year that discomfort went away relatively quickly; after a night I felt better,\u201d upper Brian Choi said. \u201cIt was overall a great success, super quick and super painless,\u201d Asch said.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

        "title_plain": "Let&#8217;s Talk About Race",
        "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A<\/span><span class=\"s1\">s part of the Exeter community, we are all so lucky to have the opportunity to be here. We are constantly able to learn, not just from teachers and textbooks, but also from each other. That is why it is so imperative that we acknowledge that within our community, there can still be people who are more privileged than others. Last Tuesday, fellow Exonians came together to share their Exeter experiences during Assembly. The one recurring theme was how their race plays an important role in their lives. From having your ethnicity questioned to being attacked with racial slurs on the streets of Exeter to having your identity scrutinized, there are issues some of us face that others simply don\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">Race is one of the hardest conversations to have with friends, family, strangers, but it&#8217;s often the difficult conversations that are the most important and turn out to be the most rewarding.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Race is an issue that many are uncomfortable with talking about. It often sparks controversy because we recognize the social implications of being called a racist. Many people are reluctant to talk about it as it is considered an \u201cintense\u201d or even taboo subject. One thing is undebatable though: There is a problem with race in this country. In America, people of color have been and continue to be subjected to oppression, so much so that it could be considered tradition. From the earliest unspeakable atrocities committed against Native Americans, to slavery, to the Chinese Exclusion Act, to modern day police brutality and anti-immigrant sentiment, can we really say that our fight for civil rights is over? <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Interestingly, people have come up with their own way to tackle this problem: simply not speaking about it. They believe that through not talking about race and proclaiming that they \u201cdon\u2019t see color,\u201d the issues pertaining to racism (which is itself a plague) will immediately go away. As a person of color, my race is important to me\u2014it is a part of my identity, something that makes me uniquely me along with my sexual orientation and my interests. To strip me of my race is to deny that I am who I am. I don\u2019t want people to be blind to that part of me, but instead accept it and define their opinion of me by my merits and faults.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Not seeing someone\u2019s race also implies that we are dismissing the genuine struggles that they face because of their race. People are still persecuted every single day due to the color of their skin\u2014for example, the stop-and-frisk policy and discrimination in housing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The fact that some people can choose not to talk about race stems from a place of privilege. Although it\u2019s easier to revert immediately back to more comfortable topics of school and social gossip, I encourage us to not stop talking about race. For people of color, race is often a thing that they have to battle: who they are versus other people\u2019s preconceived stereotypes of them due to that very aspect of themselves. It can transform into something you love and hate at the same time. Race isn\u2019t something you can shed at the door. It changes your perspective of the world and its perspective of you, coloring a reality that people have to live through every single day of their lives. For white people, there is a responsibility to advocate for every human\u2019s right to live without fear and the threat of persecution. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Someone once said that instead of being a melting pot, America should be a salad bowl. Everything exists together in harmony, but each piece retains its own individual texture and taste. It is our different cultures coming together that makes America worth celebrating, and to erase them all would be a shame. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">By not being afraid to initiate conversations regarding race, through asking thoughtful questions, we can help make Exeter a more inclusive community.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

        "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Playful howls and barks fill the quads and trails surrounding Exeter as faculty take their dogs for walks. Exeter is not only a home for over a thousand students and a faculty families, but also a place for their dogs. The stretches of green lawn and expansive river walks like Swasey Parkway provide the perfect running ground for dogs of all colors, ages, sizes and hair textures to thrive. This week in the Doggie Spotlight we will focus on the profiles and personalities of a few select dogs.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\">Oliver<\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">Breed: German Shepard<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Owner: Lundy Smith<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-16613\" src=\"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/EXY_102016_A008-3-1.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"420\" srcset=\"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/EXY_102016_A008-3-1.jpg 763w, https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/EXY_102016_A008-3-1-525x689.jpg 525w, https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/EXY_102016_A008-3-1-53x70.jpg 53w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Faculty have praised Exeter as a wonderful environment to raise a dog. English instructor Lundy Smith said that for his dog Oliver, the campus is like \u201cheaven.\u201d \u201cOliver loves the attention he gets from the kids, plus the Academy woods are a great place to explore.\u201d Oliver is a two and a half year-old German Shepherd who, like most German Shepherds, may appear rowdy and intimidating at first, but once you have adjusted to this, you will see Oliver\u2019s compassionate side. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Oliver is a dog who loves his owner, his little brother, playing with the girls of Langdell (where Mr. Smith is dorm faculty) and running on the beach. Smith added that he enjoys playing with Pete Flynn. Smith said that Oliver\u2019s love of Caldwell\u2019s dog is unrequited. \u201cIt\u2019s a herding thing, Smith said. \u201cHe\u2019s also terrified of Ms. Geer\u2019s white cat.\u201d Although Oliver and Smith are not dorm residents, Smith still emphasized how Phillips Exeter became a home to him. \u201cThere are lots of squirrels, plenty of food on the ground outside of Wentworth, lots of kids to throw his ball and pet him and he is getting a first-rate education,\u201d Smith said.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\">Angus<\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">Breed: Australian Cobberdog<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Owner: Joanne Lembo<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-16615\" src=\"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/EXY_102016_A008-1.jpg\" alt=\"EXY_102016_A008-1\" width=\"320\" height=\"427\" srcset=\"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/EXY_102016_A008-1.jpg 720w, https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/EXY_102016_A008-1-525x700.jpg 525w, https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/EXY_102016_A008-1-53x70.jpg 53w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Director of Student Activities Joanne Lembo owns an Australian Cobberdog named Angus. Lembo said that the best part of having a dog on campus is the students. \u201cAngus was the shyest dog in the litter. The breeder chose our family because we lived on campus and he would be well socialized,\u201d she said. Lembo enjoys the help from students when it come to dog sitting. \u201cI am able to come home and walk him and he has many student friends on campus who also walk him,\u201d she said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Angus\u2019s shyness has been largely cured since living at Exeter, and now he even has frequent playdates with both students and other canines. For Lembo, having a dog on campus is fantastic not only for her and the students, and when asked if Angus likes being at Exeter, she responded, \u201cHe loves it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\">Dolly Bubbles<\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">Breed: English Labrador<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Owner: Patty Burke<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16614\" src=\"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/EXY_102016_A008-2.jpg\" alt=\"EXY_102016_A008-2\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" srcset=\"https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/EXY_102016_A008-2.jpg 320w, https:\/\/theexonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/EXY_102016_A008-2-93x70.jpg 93w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Dolly Bubbles. You may have seen her frolicking on the quad or trotting next to her trusty partner English instructor Patricia Burke, who lives in Langdell Hall. Burke cherishes her 9-year-old English labrador. \u201cI love having a dog on campus, or rather, I should say Dolly loves being a dog on campus,\u201d she said. Burke also noticed that Dolly is a very social dog, \u201cIn fact, I think she\u2019s 75 percent human and thrives in the company of others. When we walk, she has to say hello to everyone, other dogs as well as people.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">According to Burke, Dolly truly thinks of Langdell as a home. She is content to hanging in the common room to lick feet until the end of time. Dolly enjoys other pastimes. Burke said, \u201cIf all her dreams were to come true, she\u2019d spend her days with facilities, riding around in trucks or cars or mowers with the wind blowing her ears back and people waving to her, shouting, \u2018Hello Dolly!\u2019\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As far as socializing with other dogs, Dolly prefers hanging out with humans. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t really have playdates with other dogs,\u201d Burke said. \u201cShe\u2019d rather go to the mailroom and see Emily or Joe or Dwight.\u201d Dolly also enjoys time with her brother, upper Gavin Hickey, and with the girls of Langdell, although she is careful not to overlap with Oliver whom she has had altercations with in the past. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

        "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">F<\/span><span class=\"s1\">or over 20 years, the world has struggled with how to welcome members of the great middle eastern migration across borders when their own countries have failed. Some people say that welcoming middle eastern migrants is dangerous because they are too commonly affiliated with terrorist groups, but others argue that taking in migrant workers strengthens the economy. While the threat of terrorism is serious and lingering, we must stop associating all middle easterners and especially Muslims as being dangerous people. The sooner we can accept that the benefits welcoming refugees far outweigh the concern of their allegiances, the better off we will be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I would like to turn to the slightly scaled-down example of the city of Riace, Italy. In the last 18 years, they have brought in more than 6,000 refugees into their town. Domenico Lucano, the mayor of Riace said in an NPR interview that the migration of refugees actually revived what was soon becoming a ghost town. \u201cTo those who fear migrants bringing disease, taking away jobs and sense of security,\u201d he said, \u201cthey bring us their culture, their world, their colors and their knowledge.\u201d Since then, Riace has thrived in its economy, employment rates and tourism and has been strengthened in cultural diversity and in connections between community members.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3 pullquote\">Associating an entire culture with violence and terrorism is not realistic, nor is it compatible with a history where the United States has welcomed the starving and sick at our borders.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">In the NPR piece, some of the refugees who have now become full Italian citizens were talking about their experiences with the brutality of their homelands and how the people of Riace had helped heal them. By sharing their stories with the locals, and the locals in turn helping the migrants begin new lives, the immigration of refugees arguably has taught the inhabitants a deeper understanding of world politics and empathy, as well as provided a backbone for their municipal economy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Here in the United States, we speak of building a wall enclosing our untouchable society. We call for closer border control with Mexico to filter immigrants as we wish. This idea, to me, is extremely ironic. Ever since our primary settlement, this country is made up of other countries. \u201cAmericans\u201d are really Irish, Puerto Rican, British, Chinese, Canadian, Welch, French, Italian and Mexican. We are built on the spine of a collaborative and inclusive culture, one that iconically provides a welcoming harbor for migrants who left their home countries in hopes of a better life, a new start. We are a country of immigrants, that is just the reality. The notion that a literal wall must be built to exclude the immigration of people who are struggling in their home countries is backwards and selfish. If terrorism is really the pure concern, this is not the solution. Acts of terrorism, such as the tragic shooting at the Orlando night club, happen from the inside out. Gun violence exists everywhere, and in most cases it has nothing to do with our scrutiny of the borders. Terrorism doesn\u2019t infiltrate, it begins and infiltrates from there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Associating an entire culture with violence and terrorism is not realistic, nor is it compatible with a history where the United States has welcomed the starving and sick at our borders. Frankly, it strikes me as a bit racist. These people are not gunman, they are carpet makers, farmers, quilt embroiderers and so much more. We have the opportunity to remain a country strong with cultural diversity, and we are staining this reputation with propositions like \u201cThe Wall.\u201d It is in everyone\u2019s best interest that we ditch the finger-pointing game, and defeat terrorism with a stronger plan. We can be the land of opportunity once again, if we open our minds to what is possible when we work together. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

        "content": "<p class=\"p1\">While the athletics department works diligently to make sure that boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 sports teams receive equal opportunity in support, transportation, coaching and equipment, perceived discrepancies remain. Senior Daniela Nemirovsky, who is a captain of the girls\u2019 varsity soccer team and runs track, said that these differences are a concern for many female athletes. However, Athletic Director Shane LaPointe said that they are mostly misconceptions and misunderstandings.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">LaPointe was named Athletic Director last year and said that the school works to give all teams equal opportunities. However, differences in equipment or recourse for certain teams can be mistaken for gender prejudice, while often it is due to requirement differences between sports. Football, for instance, due to a large team size and the need for expensive equipment, almost always requires more funding, LaPointe said. That being said, certain funding is out of the athletic director\u2019s hands, which can account for certain teams receiving gifts or food from parents, or large donations from outside donors who have given to certain teams in the past.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Nemirovsky cited the example that many of her girls teams travel by Red Dragon for games that are an hour and a half away, while the football teams travel by a more luxurious coach bus \u201cwherever they go.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cLast year girls\u2019 volleyball was undefeated and they still got [fewer] fans than football. [And] girls soccer always gets [fewer] fans than boys.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">According to LaPointe, though, any team going an hour and a half away from Exeter to play will get a coach bus, and only teams going about half an hour away will get a Red Dragon.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Nemirovsky also said that she has heard that boys\u2019 hockey gets free pizza from the school after every game, whereas girls\u2019 hockey doesn\u2019t, and other girls\u2019 teams, such as soccer, rely on parents and coaches for any after game food. Nemirovsky said she wasn\u2019t \u201ccompletely sure\u201d about whether or not the boys\u2019 hockey team food is funded by the school, and did acknowledge that the perception was based in rumor. Also, girls sports teams usually have fewer attendees for their events than their male counterparts on the field, which Nemirovsky said can be hard to combat. She acknowledged that athletes \u201ccan\u2019t really fault people for what they like.\u201d However, she said that positive reinforcement can have a substantial effect on attendance. \u201cIf there\u2019s a lot of people [attending a game], then more are going to want to go; whereas we do have fans, but most of them, for soccer at least, are parents,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Senior Matthew McShea, who plays hockey and lacrosse, said that one way teams can support one another and boost attendance is if the boys\u2019 hockey goes to watch girls\u2019 basketball and vice versa.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Upper Charlotte Polk, who plays volleyball, basketball and lacrosse, also noticed an uneven distribution of fans at games, and that not many people attended games, even when the girls\u2019 basketball team won the championships her prep year. When there are fans, family and friends usually make up the crowd. While this is something Polk said is not easily regulated, there is usually a consistently lower crowd turnout for girls\u2019 sports.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Other athletes felt poor attendance was also impacted by games\u2019 schedules, during E\/a games in particular. According to Nemirovsky, the girls\u2019 games are often put in the same hour and a half time slot, while boys\u2019 soccer and football have their own times.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cLast year girls\u2019 volleyball was undefeated and they still got [fewer] fans than football,\u201d Nemirovsky said. \u201c[And] girls soccer always gets [fewer] fans than boys.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Lapointe said that she makes an effort to show that each individual student\u2019s participation in a team is important and respected, and herself attends varsity and junior varsity. If a student is showing up six days a week to a sport, that is a big commitment that the athletics department tries to honor, she said.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Separate perceived injustices lie in investment and coaching. Senior Bonnie LaBont\u00e9, who plays hockey, field hockey and lacrosse, said that girls\u2019 teams are often given less seasoned coaches, and that the athletics program for girls is overall less \u201cintense\u201d and \u201celite.\u201d History instructor Nolan Lincoln served as an assistant coach last year to the girls\u2019 soccer team, but according to LaBont\u00e9, he was moved to coach boys\u2019 soccer \u201cwhen they found out that he was [a] good [coach].\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">LaBont\u00e9 also noticed a pattern of girls\u2019 coaches staying with their teams for shorter periods of time, and questioned why there aren\u2019t enough experienced replacements. LaBont\u00e9 suggested Exeter hire more coaches who may not be from within the community, but who are \u201cnot new to [their] sport, have taught a club team and have been an assistant.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Labonte also said that the girls\u2019 hockey team was trying to come to Exeter a few days before Thanksgiving break ends, something the boys\u2019 hockey team \u201chas done for as long as [she] can remember,\u201d but it was met with resistance.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In her first year as athletic director, LaPointe has focused on making athletics more risk free, with the help of CFO David Hanson\u2019s risk management efforts, but also hopes to address these perceived inconsistencies.<\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

(Preferably in the form of an A on their next paper to appease their parents).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In another desperate attempt, students have been frantically signing up for ESSO clubs in order to give their lives more value than their estimated end-of-term GPA, which, lower than last term\u2019s, haunts their dreams.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Faculty members have admitted to being slightly confused at the panic, since midterms don\u2019t really mean anything except for being a mild kick-in-the butt to work a little harder and stay up a little later doing homework.

Stiff off the bus with a mere 20 minutes before the race, the boys laced up their spikes unaffected by the unadvantageous circumstances. As the gun went off, adrenaline filled their bodies and all that was on their minds was beating NMH.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Atticus Stonestrom managed to edge out NMH\u2019s top runner by a whopping 10 seconds, looking strong in the final grassy straight-away. He has been undefeated this season, inspiring all his teammates.Big Red took home the win by a large margin in both the varsity and junior varsity races with cumulative scores of 21-35 and 15-50 respectively, a big success for the team as a whole. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cAtticus, as always, did a great job leading the race,\u201d upper Alex Renaud said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">NMH is notorious for its dreaded cross country course which consists of steep, rolling hills that seem to never end. As they have much practice on their course, and since Big Red trains on mostly flat surfaces, the runners from NMH were expected to dominate at the meet. However, fortunately for Exeter, Big Red still took home the win on NMH\u2019s home turf, as well as during their own Parent\u2019s Weekend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cNMH lost some major talent with the graduating class of 2016,\u201d senior and co-captain Issay Matsumoto said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cNo matter where you come in the race, you are respected for having gone through it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Something that the boys noticed at NMH was that the team had outstanding sportsmanship, and genuinely congratulated the runners of the opposing team individually. Even during the race, NMH\u2019s coach shouted the mile splits for many Exeter runners. After the race, many of the boys exchanged uplifting remarks and handshakes that left Big Red in awe, that even a team who lost on their home turf could have such nice sportsmanship. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThis is one of the things I love about the sport,\u201d Renaud said. \u201cNo matter where you come in the race, you are respected for having gone through it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">After this race, all the meets will be at home. Coming for Exeter\u2019s Parent\u2019s Weekend this week will be Deerfield, and then E\/a will take place a couple of Saturdays later. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe have two more meets until Interschols,\u201d Matsumoto said. \u201cSo we will use those meets to get some fast times, gain some confidence and sharpen up.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

        "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Two-time defending New England champions Kat Dumoulin and Rachel Luo, the co-captain duo of the volleyball team, have seen a lot of successes in their time here at Exeter. When asked what it\u2019s like to take on the role of captain for such a historically dominant team, Dumoulin said, \u201cIt\u2019s honestly terrifying. Everyone expects a lot out of us, and we expect that out of the team.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Oftentimes, this expectation motivates Dumoulin to push her girls when training. Luo also pointed out that the high expectations for a defending championship team come from how hard the team has worked over the past two seasons. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Dumoulin first took on the sport in her sophomore year of high school in her hometown. Although Dumoulin was initially committed to field hockey throughout middle school and freshman year as her fall sport, she couldn\u2019t get over how much she loved volleyball, having trained in many summer camps. \u201cAt first, I was awful. The only thing I had going for me was that I wasn\u2019t afraid to run full speed at a ball and throw myself onto the ground to get it up,\u201d Dumoulin said. She explained that her old coach only took her because she was \u201cgutsy.\u201d However, that train of thought resonated with Dumoulin throughout the season, which ultimately got her onto the starting squad. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The following year, repeating as a lower at Exeter, Dumoulin made the varsity team. Coach Shang told her early in that season that she would rarely see the court as there were three upperclassmen playing over her, but Dumoulin knew she would find a way to play. Finding strength in her serve, Dumoulin became an important piece to a New England Championship team, playing in all three sets in the final game of the season. \u201cTo me, it revealed that hard work and fearlessness can conquer anything,\u201d Dumoulin said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><br \/>\nIt\u2019s a certainty that Dumoulin and Luo can easily agree on one thing: Coach Shang has been a major factor in their impressive developments during their time here. \u201cShang\u2019s one of the most incredible coaches; I mean, the guy has two coaches of the year for a reason,\u201d Luo said. Luo expressed her gratitude for getting to play with him over the years, saying that no one is more committed to a team than Shang, who has also served as a father figure over the last three years. \u201cI can\u2019t even begin to say how much that means to me,\u201d Luo said. Dumoulin also asserted that Coach Shang is the best coach she\u2019s ever had. She explained that Shang is very unbiased and plays athletes solely based on efforts and performance in practice. A notable point for Dumoulin is that Shang doesn\u2019t put up with the team\u2019s drama, which has helped the two captains along with the team stay focused and primed in practice. \u201cIt\u2019s really refreshing because he\u2019s one of the main reasons for the past two years, the volleyball team was so close,\u201d Dumoulin said.When Luo was introduced to the game in sixth grade, she immediately fell in love with the sport. For her, she has found her passion in the resilience of the game. \u201cYou can be down 24-10 and still come back to win the game,\u201d Luo said. Reflecting on her time as an athlete, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s crazy how far I\u2019ve come; in sixth grade I couldn\u2019t for the life of me serve a ball overhand. In comparison, now the goal has become to serve to specific spots on the court.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cThey are incredible leaders and do a great job of bringing energy and enthusiasm to practice every day.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Upper Margaret Kraus said that Luo puts 100 percent into everything she does and is always there to listen or give advice. She added that Dumoulin is one of the most spirited girls during practice, who the team can count on to pick people up and push teammates to stay motivated. \u201cEveryone would agree that we have a very positive team dynamic this year, and a lot of that is due to the atmosphere that Rachel and Kat established at the beginning of the season,\u201d Kraus said. Lower Jenny Yang agreed. \u201cBoth Kat and Rachel are very strong players, but my favorite thing about them is that they will always be there to support you,\u201d she said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Upper Charlotte Polk admired their \u201cfierce\u201d devotion to the team and the sport. \u201cThey are incredible leaders and do a great job of bringing energy and enthusiasm to practice every day,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As the season\u2019s end rapidly approaches, Luo said that she wants to \u201cgive back to the team.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cExeter volleyball has given me so many amazing memories, and it\u2019s made my time at Exeter so much more worthwhile, and I just hope I can do the same for the girls on the team,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

Exeter was only down 7-0 heading into the second half of the game, but a few big plays by Suffield put them up 27-7 and Exeter could not answer back. Exeter added yet another loss to its record.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe team lost because we gave up a couple of big plays in the third quarter. Besides that, we played a great game against Suffield,\u201d senior and co-captain David O\u2019Donnell said, adding, \u201cThe team took another step in the right direction over the weekend. Everyone put in 100 percent effort.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Overall, the team has been outscored in every game by 17 points or more. The team has struggled, especially in second halves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">O\u2019Donnell noted that the team needs to \u201cimprove our pass coverage against Deerfield. We will do that by drilling against their offensive plays all week in practice.\u201d Senior and co-captain Jack Farrell said that this week, \u201cWe\u2019re going to play solid defense and get some points on the board.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cThe team lost because we gave up a couple of big plays in the third quarter.

This weekend is the Academy\u2019s Family Weekend and Deerfield is also one of the team\u2019s biggest rivals. Farrell acknowledged the magnitude of the game. \u201cThis week will be a big game and a fun one to watch.

        "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With a 2-0 win against Northfield Mo<\/span><span class=\"s1\">unt Hermon School (NMH) last Saturday, Exeter\u2019s JV field hockey team added yet another victory to its undefeated record this season. The team now has a total of eight wins and two ties, and is currently the Academy\u2019s only undefeated girls\u2019 team.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While the team came out on top in its game against NMH, many felt that it was their hardest match of the season. Describing it as \u201ca rough game for a lot of players,\u201d upper and co-captain Vivienne Kraus said that she and her teammates \u201cwere playing sloppier than was ideal.\u201d Nevertheless, the team still managed to \u201cgo hard\u201d and control the ball for the majority of the game, according to Kraus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The strength of the team\u2019s defense has proven crucial to their success. With only four goals scored against them so far, the strong line of defense has been \u201cthe key to our good season,\u201d lower Camilla Pelliccia said. The girls have won game after game without giving up a single point, which is a direct result of the defense knowing \u201cexactly what to do and where to be,\u201d upper Ellie Locke explained. In particular, she praised Kraus, a center back, who \u201cdoes a great job guiding the defense\u2019s positioning on the field.\u201d For Kraus, the team\u2019s ability to win games without a single goal against them is a sign that the defense is working hard to keep the ball out and, of course, that \u201cour lovely goalie Ellie Locke is making saves.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Upper and co-captain Victoria Glidden also pointed out that the team\u2019s defense can be counted on to pass the ball up to the forwards, who then \u201cwork really hard in the circle by staying on the posts, goalie and stroke.\u201d Locke agreed, remarking that the forward line has done an \u201cincredible job\u201d scoring. \u201cWe scored 9 goals during our first game of the year, which is outrageous,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Though this is certainly a testament to the raw talent of the girls, much of their success has come from their unrelenting work ethic and high energy throughout the season. \u201cWe all work really hard in practice and get really fired up before the games,\u201d lower Gracie Goodwin explained. For her, the best part about the team is \u201cknowing when we really need to leave it all out on the field.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Both Goodwin and Glidden emphasized that part of this motivation arises from the continual support and encouragement from their coach, Sydnee Goddard. \u201cShe pushes us really hard with things like sprints and two-mile warm up runs that build up our endurance, which is one thing that really separates us from a lot of other teams,\u201d Glidden explained.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cWe went into that game with a lot of energy, probably the most of any game thus far, and it really paid off.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Kraus agreed, observing that Goddard challenges every player to improve, regardless of the skill level with which they came into the season. \u201cHonestly our season has been this good because of our amazing coach,\u201d Glidden said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This hard work has paid off all season, but especially so in the girls\u2019 game against Deerfield Academy three weeks ago. \u201cWe went into that game with a lot of energy, probably the most of any game thus far, and it really paid off,\u201d Locke said. Deerfield was an important game for the team because, before last year, Exeter had not beat them in 25 years. \u201cWe knew that we needed to beat them and keep the streak from last year going,\u201d Goodwin added.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Given their unbroken winning streak, the girls are in a strong position for the rest of the season, as long as they continue to play with focus and energy. \u201cWe\u2019re so used to winning that we\u2019ve lost a bit of excitement on the field, so it\u2019s vital we work to bring that back,\u201d Locke said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Going forward, the team plans to work on their ability to switch positions seamlessly and effectively, as well as their attitude and teamwork. \u201cWe can\u2019t just be complacent with where we are, even though we\u2019re winning,\u201d Kraus pointed out. \u201cEvery girl on the team has worked to keep us in our undefeated season, and we all want it to continue.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

Knicks:<\/b> After the early season success of Derrick Rose, the New York Knicks will decide that they want as many players who have pending legal cases. That means picking up Ty Lawson, Iman Shumpert and Greg Oden. When they all simultaneously get arrested for being in Ty Lawson\u2019s car as he goes on another DUI, the Knicks don\u2019t have anyone who can play basketball. They finish lower than the Nets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>2. Pistons:<\/b> The city of Detroit decides that a great way to get out of an economic slump would be to force the Pistons to leave their city, getting rid of millions of dollars in tourist revenue. The Pistons owner throws a hissy fit, and decides to not let his team win a game for their last season in Detroit. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>3. Magic:<\/b> Disney World declares sharia law. The Magic aren\u2019t allowed to play basketball anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>4. Bucks:<\/b> The entire team dies of cheese poisoning. That\u2019s one of the dangers of playing in Milwaukee.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>5. Hornets:<\/b> No one on the team is allowed to go to the bathroom (they play in Charlotte). They all demand trades, and the Hornets trade them all for draft picks. They have no more players, so they don\u2019t win a game.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>6. Wizards:<\/b> It is discovered that they aren\u2019t actually Wizards after John Wall tests positive for fairy dust. They decide to change their name back to the Bullets, which is a mistake. The liberals in Washington decide to outlaw the team.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>7. 76ers:<\/b> They\u2019re the 76ers.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

        "title_plain": "Climate Matters",
        "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have spent a lot of time and energy eroding each other\u2019s Achilles Heels. The conservative front pounces on anything that could shed more light on Hillary\u2019s email scandal, while the liberal media baits Trump with provocative statements on immigration and his history of sexual misconduct. In this incessant exchange of insults, one might forget that neither candidate has addressed the issue of climate change and proposed a strategy for working with other countries to mitigate the brewing environmental disaster. Yes, Hillary, it\u2019s easy to call global warming an \u201coverwhelming challenge\u201d and pronounce your willingness to attend lavish international conferences that get nothing done. Sure, Donald, it\u2019s funny to proclaim environmental concerns as a figment of China\u2019s imagination and then point to the devastation Asian firms have caused in Detroit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Mr. Trump, have you looked at pictures of northern Chinese cities drenched in smog, or listened to the unequivocal expertise of most scientists? The United States\u2019 hegemony rests not on its ability to force other nations to take responsibility for our problems and provide global public goods. Rather, our hegemony relies on our willingness to set an example for other countries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The United States does not need leaders like George W. Bush, who refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol because of the asymmetric burdens it placed on developed and developing nations. Does Mr. Bush want Bangladeshi or Nepalese firms to increase their production costs and therefore hamper their progress? Countries like the United Kingdom suffered most from pollution during their Industrial Revolutions and only became environmentally-conscious once they had reached a certain level of economic development. Only mature economic countries have the capacity to absorb the costs of environmental preservation without demanding large sacrifices from their citizens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Obama has impressed many Americans with his commitment to protecting our natural wonders, safeguarding millions of acres of land. Indeed, he has bypassed Congress in many cases and used his executive powers to establish standards for energy efficiency and air\/water pollution. His r\u00e9sum\u00e9 on international environmental negotiations, however, leaves much to be desired.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">After the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, leaders from around the world\u2014including Obama\u2014retreated to their respective countries to proclaim their commitment to and success in fighting global warming. Really? Do they think that countries and firms will give up their financial ambitions and instead strive to limit global emissions to two degrees Celsius? With no precision regarding the size of each country\u2019s contribution, and no enforcement mechanisms, the deal accomplishes nothing but create a guise of progress. The agreement will inevitably result in the collective action problem, a condition in which all actors defect on their commitments in anticipation that others will pay for the cost of providing the good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Hillary Clinton will have to do more than sign agreements and write lengthy standards; she will have to provide economic incentives for reducing emissions to companies who have long ignored the externalities that their factories created.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The United States could learn from Europe, whose countries have remarkably high ratings on the Environmental Protection Index. In 2005, Europe implemented the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). Covering the dirtiest industries and thousands of factories throughout Europe, the plan allocates tradable allowances for greenhouse gases to each firm. To exceed the designated amount of emissions, a company must purchase credits from other firms. This system motivates firms to reduce their emissions without infringing on their profits. Every few years, ETS lowers the emissions cap, forcing firms to lower emissions but also increasing the value of the credit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">I believe the United States could create an analogous agreement with like-minded countries like Canada. However, I caution the United States from working in large coalitions, as smaller groups of countries often strike more meaningful concessions and can better monitor their commitments. Nonetheless, the next president must forge strong agreements not only with domestic companies, but also with other governments to build momentum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Unfortunately, there are very few examples in which world leaders have cooperated to help the environment. Fatalists and pessimists like Donald Trump deny that anything can be done to alleviate the problem. Optimists point to the Vienna Convention and Montreal Protocol on chlorofluorocarbons in demonstrating the international community\u2019s capacity to act when it\u2019s urgent.

        "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Exeter\u2019s varsity field hockey team traveled down to Northfield Mount Hermon School (NMH) for another difficult match last weekend. NMH had only lost three games this season, posing a tough challenge for Exeter\u2019s team. Even though the girls gave their best effort, they fell 0-3, leaving them with a record of 4-6.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As for the referee, there was nothing that the girls could do about it, despite the fact that several Big Red players thought the referees seemed to be calling a one-sided game. Lower Catherine Griffin noted that, \u201cThere were many complaints about the refs\u2026 A lot of people were frustrated by their calls.\u201d Even though the team was at first distracted by the seeming bias, they got used to it and refocused their attention on the game.From the start of the game, there were two things that proved difficult for Big Red: a couple of skilled NMH players and the referee, about whom several of the girls complained. NMH had a couple of extremely talented opponents, but these players stood out immediately with their strong play. Luckily, the Exeter girls identified the talented players quickly and paid extra attention to defending against them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Similar to their game against Milton, the Exeter girls found themselves playing more defense than offense. While the team\u2019s goalies played very well, stopping numerous shots, the powerful NMH proved to be too much of a challenge and were able to get the ball past Exeter\u2019s stout defense three times. Still, the girls never gave up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The majority of the goals scored against Exeter were from NMH\u2019s corners. These set pieces proved to be challenging for Exeter\u2019s defense, according to Griffin. \u201cWe did well at recovering to play defense, but I think we need to work on our defensive corners because that is how they scored most of their goals,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cThere were many complaints about the refs\u2026 A lot of people were frustrated by their calls.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">NMH\u2019s strong players proved to be a problem on both offense and defense, stopping many of the team\u2019s attacks. The scoreless game did not mean that Exeter never took any shots. In fact, the team had many quality chances, but failed to translate them into goals. According to senior Michaela Corvi, one of the difficulties for the team this year has just been being a young team. \u201cPlaying together we are just a young team and I think if we played them again the outcome would be very different.\u201d This optimism is shared by the entire team, and they understand that this year\u2019s young team has plenty of potential in the future. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This Wednesday, the team will play Tilton, but they are hopeful to win because they were victorious 2-0 last year. Once the girls pass Tilton, they have a home game against Brooks for parents weekend. Coach Pacific said it will be a big game. \u201cNot only is Brooks is strong team, but it is also breast cancer awareness game,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

        "title_plain": "Author Nicole Dennis-Benn Speaks on Identity",
        "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Author Nicole Dennis-Benn spoke about finding her voice as a member of the Jamaican middle class, a black lesbian, an activist and a writer at Friday\u2019s assembly. She also held a lunch in the Latin Study, attended English classes throughout the day and signed books at the Water Street Bookstore on Thursday night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Born and raised in Jamaica, Dennis-Benn came to the United States to escape the more oppressive sides of her country and to attend Cornell University. Though she began her career working as a researcher at Columbia University, she realized eventually that her true passion lay in writing. She has an MFA in Creative Writing from Sarah Lawrence College and lives in Brooklyn with her wife. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At assembly, Dennis-Benn read excerpts from and discussed her first novel, \u201cHere Comes The Sun,\u201d which she published in July and referred to as her \u201clove letter to Jamaica.\u201d \u201cHere Comes The Sun\u201d has received a starred <i>Kirkus Review<\/i> and recognition from <i>The New York Times, NPR, BBC, Buzzfeed, Book Riot, Bookish, Elle, Marie Claire, Entertainment Weekly, The Feminist Wire and Cosmopolitan<\/i>, among other publications. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Dennis-Benn discussed the importance of speaking up and self expression, as well as addressing issues of racial and social inequality and how the media propagates them. She also provided insight on how to solve them. She described the power of writing and of finding a voice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cWhen you think about paradise you don\u2019t think about people shaming you or rejecting you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Here Comes The Sun<\/i> highlights Jamaica\u2019s complexities and documented the lives of people who are often silenced there. The novel reflected Dennis-Benn\u2019s own experience as a queer woman of color in Jamaica, a country often portrayed as a kind of paradise despite its reality of harsh classism, homophobia and misogyny. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">According to Dennis-Benn, she wrote her novel in part to give voice to the silenced working class women in her home country. \u201cI really want to shed light on stories and dispel myths that people have,\u201d she said. \u201cI really wanted to capture the individuals who aren\u2019t usually capitalized on the page.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">She also hoped to dispel the false perception many have of Jamaica as a dreamland. \u201cWhen you think about paradise you don\u2019t think about people shaming you or rejecting you,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The passage Dennis-Benn read at assembly portrayed a 15-year-old character\u2019s hatred of her skin tone, describing \u201cdark patches that need to be rubbed\u201d away with bleach.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Following her reading, Dennis-Benn spoke about the dangers of silence and the importance of speaking up. She explained that she returned to Jamaica following the release of her book and found a more open dialogue about Jamaican women\u2019s identities and sexualities. \u201cI come from a country of secrecy,\u201d she said. \u201c[But] being a writer has empowered me to shed light on these issues. You never know who\u2019s listening.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">She went on, referencing Audrey Lorde\u2019s belief that our silences do not protect us. \u201cIf you let your silences cripple you, that won\u2019t help. You\u2019re hurting yourself more by swallowing a lot of things,\u201d she said. \u201cThe minute we start speaking up we realize that we are not just liberating ourselves, we are liberating others.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lower Gabrielle Brown, who lived in Jamaica until she was nine, commended Dennis-Benn\u2019s energy. \u201cI liked that she spoke with a lot of passion about issues that were important to her,\u201d Brown said. Brown celebrated Dennis-Benn\u2019s message about creating conversation and believed that the Exeter community could take away the message to \u201cstep out of our comfort zone\u201d to talk about important issues. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For lower Isadora Kron, Dennis-Benn provided insight on the power of self expression. \u201cShe inspired me as a writer to put more meaning behind what I write,\u201d Kron said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Many appreciated seeing the school bring a woman so representative of diversity to the campus. Lower Mary Provencal-Fogarty expressed gratitude for this. \u201cWe talk about racism on campus, but not nearly enough,\u201d she said. \u201cA queer woman of color coming to campus was exactly what we needed to open our eyes. I was snapping along to almost everything she said.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As a black Caribbean, upper Robyn Smith said it was powerful to get to hear a woman that she could relate to. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThere really aren&#8217;t that many role models in the media that are available to me, so meeting her and chatting with her made me feel empowered,\u201d Smith said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Brown also related with the juxtaposition that Dennis-Benn described of \u201cbeing invisible in Jamaica,\u201d but also feeling \u201cself-conscious about being black no matter your skin tone,\u201d in the US. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For many, Dennis-Benn\u2019s assembly seemed a fitting follow up to last week\u2019s assembly, which addressed issues of race on campus. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Cady Crowley found connections between Dennis-Benn\u2019s speech and the stories Exeter\u2019s students of color shared last Tuesday. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cSince a lot of Exonians are international, her speech relates to how they come here, and [how] it\u2019s a different culture for them,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Religion instructor and Assembly Committee member Kathleen Brownback explained that intersectionality is one of the themes the Assembly Committee chose for the year. \u201cIt was interesting to hear her describe that her racial identity is of course not an issue in Jamaica but her lesbianism is,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd race is an issue here but as a lesbian in Brooklyn she feels much more freedom.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Smith too said that Dennis-Benn\u2019s words reminded her of the idea of intersectionality. She emphasized the importance of reflecting on the diversity within the black community that Dennis-Benn brought up. \u201cOften times people try to group everyone of a certain range of skin tones as one ethnicity, assuming that everyone is African-American,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBut there are so many identities within the same race that are often forgotten.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

        "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Local restaurant Penang and Tokyo (Penang) reopened on Oct. 11, after closing its doors earlier this year. Following 17 years of business, Penang had unexpectedly stopped business on June 19, a decision many in the community believed to be permanent. Penang is well-known on campus for being the only restaurant to serve sushi in town and delivering when other restaurants shutter their delivery services. With the return of the restaurant, Exonians can once again enjoy the broad menu of Malaysian, Chinese and Japanese cuisines.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The restaurant had abruptly ended business, announcing its closure through a Facebook post made 10 days in advance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cTo our dear customers: Sunday, June 19, 2016 (Father&#8217;s Day) will be Penang and Tokyo\u2019s last day of business. We would like to thank all of our friends and customers for the past 17 years. Sincerely, Penang and Tokyo Restaurant.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The message followed the closure of several local restaurants during the previous school year, such as Good Karma and Rogan\u2019s.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The wording had led many Exonians to believe the change was permanent. \u201cI thought they closed down for good,\u201d said senior Efia Nuako. However, the restaurant announced that the closure was not permanent in September, finalizing a reopening date on Oct. 7, again through Facebook. <i>The Exonian<\/i> also previously reported that Penang\u2019s closure had been permanent, leading to further confusion and miscommunication.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201c[Penang] kind of brings my dorm together because a lot of the time we ask others in the dorm if they want to order and we eat together which is a pretty good bonding experience.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Upper Pa Sukhum speculated that the abrupt closing and reopening was intended to attract attention to the restaurant, bringing in more customers. \u201cHonestly I think [the closure] was a publicity stunt, them opening and reopening, hence why they never sold the land. I guess it worked; there were lots of people when I went to eat there.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Many members of the Exeter community were overjoyed by the announcement of the reopening. \u201cI was very Excited when I heard the news,\u201d upper Chiara Perotti Chorea said, as she had \u201cbeen wanting to go [to Penang] ever since school started.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The restaurant\u2019s speedy and reliable delivery service had been missed in their brief closure. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI&#8217;m happy Penang&#8217;s reopening cause I used to order from there a lot,\u201d Nuako said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Exonians also missed Penang\u2019s signature sushi, the only available in Exeter. \u201cI was really happy about the Penang reopening because it&#8217;s the only place I can get sushi in Exeter,\u201d upper Jacqui Byrne said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While Penang was closed, the Exeter community had a lack of restaurant options after 10 p.m., causing a lack of late-night delivery and Saturday night hang out options. \u201c[Penang] was the only restaurant in town that was open until 11 p.m. on Saturday and it was nice to go there later at night,\u201d upper Pedro Sandon said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Penang has brought Exonians together over the years. Nuako noted the unifying power Penang has had in her dorm, Amen Hall. By ordering food together, the girls of Amen Hall have forged connections with one another. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201c[Penang] kind of brings my dorm together because a lot of the time we ask others in the dorm if they want to order and we eat together which is a pretty good bonding experience.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Nuako also felt that the restaurant provided much needed stress relief. Their cuisine has become a comfort food for Exonians. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI guess Penang kind of releases stress because I usually order when I have a lot to do at night and scallion pancakes are a really good snack.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The restaurant itself holds many memories for Exonians of meals shared with friends. For Perotti Chorea, dinner at Penang with friends was a weekly ritual, and the restaurant served as a shared space.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt was the regular spot for Friday dinners with some of my friends.\u201d She expressed joy at being able to return to that tradition. \u201cI\u2019m glad we can go back to that,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Byrne, too, felt an attachment to the restaurant, as it holds nostalgic value to her. \u201cI have a lot of memories at Penang,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With the return of Penang comes the return of a gathering place for many Exonians. The restaurant serves as a stress-reliever, a unifier and a source of good food. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cPenang brings people together. It\u2019s just a good place to eat some nice food and relax,\u201d Sanson said.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

This fall marks his first time on campus in over a year; he went to China through the Student Year Abroad program (SYA). Though he had never planned on going abroad, a senior in his dorm recommended he apply for the rare opportunity, and he did. In China, Green grew close to his host family and attended school, becoming fluent in the language throughout the course of the year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cHe is a great collaborator &#8230; interested in bringing people together.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Green\u2019s adviser, religion instructor Russell Weatherspoon, admired Green\u2019s desire to build on his understandings of the world. \u201cHe is a person who tries to keep his objectives clearly in mind while trying to become part of activities that can build him and strengthen and broaden his understanding,\u201d Weatherspoon said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Weatherspoon went on to commend Green\u2019s ability to unite people. \u201cHe is a great collaborator &#8230; interested in bringing people together,\u201d Weatherspoon said. \u201cHis tone and his desire to draw people together to do challenging things is particularly attractive.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Green\u2019s passion for rallying of the people has manifested in his role as co-head of ALES. Green joined the club as a prep and became co-head his lower year. \u201cThere are so many things on campus we can do to make the community more inclusive of us,\u201d he said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">His lower year, the club held a die in, where students laid on the quad to raise awareness on police brutality, and met with administration about diversifying faculty on campus. This activism inspired him to fully throw himself into the club. \u201cFrom that moment I was all in. This was what I wanted to be a part of,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Upper Athena Stenor, another co-head of ALES, described Green\u2019s passion at meetings. \u201cKelvin is unique in his ability to express and philosophize on the issues that are important to him,\u201d she said. \u201cHe&#8217;s so good at articulating thoughts, but he\u2019s also very humble about it, and he encourages other people to express themselves freely as well.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">She admires Green\u2019s ability to enact change. \u201cHe&#8217;s taught me a lot about being an activist,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s always meeting with people, and he&#8217;s always working on issues related to social justice.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Following in this vein, Green explained that he hopes to empower the preps and lowers of color on campus in the coming months. \u201cI think a big goal for me this year is to try to encourage and empower students of color on campus to speak up and go for positions and be the heads of clubs and [not to feel] disadvantaged,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Green also offers his voice in conversations at the MLK Day Committee, which plans events for Exeter\u2019s annual MLK day and thinks about how to actively make change surrounding issues of racial inequality. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Charis Edwards, another member of the MLK Day Committee, described Green\u2019s excitement about getting the community involved in campus wide conversations. \u201cI admire Kelvin\u2019s consistent dedication to the things he believes in,\u201d she said. \u201cI admire his creativity and open-mindedness to listen to other perspectives, even if they are not necessarily on par with his own.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Green\u2019s close friend, Ore Solanke, also admired Green\u2019s open-mindedness, which she has seen develop significantly since he came to Exeter. \u201cJust as much as he is willing to tell you what he\u2019s thinking, he is also very open to hearing what your side is, which wasn\u2019t really as obvious prep and lower year. Since then, he has become even more open to other opinions,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Solanke also noted how interesting it was to hear Green\u2019s thought process. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that his thoughts\/opinions are uniquely his own, and he isn\u2019t easily swayed by public opinion, but rather forms his own arguments,\u201d she said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In keeping with his socially active nature, Green has been interested in politics since his childhood, and he joined Dem Club as a prep. There, through phone banking, canvassing and engaging in conversation, he has found yet another way to make what he believes in happen. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI get so passionate, because you\u2019re really constructing the future you want and playing an active part,\u201d he said. \u201cDem Club presents all these awesome opportunities, so being able to be passionate about all of this and inspiring other people to be involved is awesome.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Edwards, a co-head of Dem Club, celebrated Green\u2019s contributions to the club. \u201cI really admire the fact that he\u2019s really interested in looking at politics as a way of enacting change, not just social reform,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has done a phenomenal job with organizing and campaigning.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">An artist as well as an activist, Green also serves as the co-head of Exeter\u2019s male step team, OutKast, alongside senior Marvin Bennett. He is so important to the club\u2019s success,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cHe has had the ideas for many of our steps and is a great guy to work with.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Green has played varsity volleyball since prep year, and this fall he resurrected Exeter\u2019s Gospel Choir. In addition, he was chosen to be one of Main Street Hall\u2019s proctors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Upper Francis Baviera Maloney appreciated Green\u2019s dedication to the dorm. \u201cKelvin is very involved in the dorm. He\u2019s a caring guy, very empathetic with the new people. He\u2019s trustworthy,\u201d Baviera said. \u201cIt\u2019s impressive because he was abroad for all of last year, but he still got the position of proctor.\u201d Lower Max Murray agreed, saying simply of Green, \u201cHe is a god.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">During his time at Exeter, Green has truly taken advantage of the Harkness style, embracing all the backgrounds and opinions that his fellow Exonians offer. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe biggest thing I\u2019ve learned at Exeter is the value of diversity and opinion, being at a table talking with different people who come from different parts of the world, different backgrounds,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the end, you unearth this understanding that you would not have been able to do on your own. I learned at Exeter how to connect with so many people even though we\u2019re all so different.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Moving forward, Green hopes to study to be a research scientist or a doctor, two careers he thinks can exist harmoniously with his desire to forge change. \u201cI think that\u2019ll be a really interesting relationship and fluid with my interest in politics and my interest in empowering youth and people of color,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Undoubtedly, Green will bring his fearless leadership skills with him to college and beyond. \u201cI like offering a new voice and encouraging people to speak up,\u201d he said. \u201cIf lots of different people speak up, we can get a more inclusive and understanding environment.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Livaslou Tanjong, another friend of Green\u2019s, commended Green for his ceaseless work to make the world a better place. \u201cKelvin also goes out of his way to help others and is constantly attempting to bridge gaps in understanding, whether it is in race or politics,\u201d she said. \u201cKelvin is extraordinary in his commitment to his community.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

What\u2019s your favorite flavor at Stillwells?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">3. What are your sisters\u2019 favorite ice cream flavors at Stillwells?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">4. What\u2019s the best class you\u2019ve taken at Exeter, and why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">5. What\u2019s your favorite subject, and why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">6. What did you do last summer?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">7. What\u2019s your favorite part of being a triplet?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">8. What\u2019s your least favorite part of being a triplet?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">9. How has going to school with your siblings affected your Exeter experience?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Joanna\u00a0Papadakis<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">1. I run track and cross country, am a co-head of ESSO Just Keep Smiling, ESSO Youth Dance Ensemble, club president for Empower 2 Play and an ESSO board member for the communications team. I also am a club attendee of ESSO Gal Pals!<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">2. My favorite Stillwells ice cream flavor is German Chocolate Cake.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">3. Lena&#8217;s favorite flavor is probably their Cookie Monster gelato and Alex&#8217;s might be their black raspberry, but I\u2019m not sure!<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">4. My best class at Exeter was probably Chemistry 220 with Mr. McTammany. It was G format and I had EF track before, so it was generally the format no one looked forward to, but our teacher made the class super interactive and fun.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">5. My favorite subject is chemistry, and I love it partly because it was something I never thought I was going to enjoy.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">6. I worked at Bottomline Technologies, a software company in Portsmouth, N.H., with their global marketing team as an intern. It was an amazing experience and I learned a lot!<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">7. I like that we never have to go anywhere truly alone. It\u2019s as though you have two automatic friends at your side no matter what!<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">8. I think sharing clothes\u2014I know most siblings hate sharing clothes, but I think it\u2019s even worse for us because we are all so close to each other. It\u2019s like WWIII if I go into Alex\u2019s closet!<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">9. I think the hardest part about Exeter is the competitive atmosphere, and then having to introduce each other into that atmosphere. I hate competing against anyone, especially my sisters, so I think we all have tried to really branch out and become interested in many different areas as a way to compensate for this.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Lena\u00a0Papadakis<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1. I\u2019m currently co-head of two science clubs (biology research and neuroscience), as well as co-head of the ESSO club Just Keep Smiling with my sister, Joanna. I\u2019m a member of another ESSO club called Youth Dance Ensemble, which is run by my sister Joanna and my best friend since kindergarten, Bella Weissman. I also work as an IT proctor and at the library circulation desk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">2. I\u2019d prefer a cupcake or a brownie over ice cream.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">3. Alex: Purple Cow Joanna: Green Monster or Death by Chocolate<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">4. AP BIOLOGY! It was my favorite class because we always had a lot of fun inside and outside of class. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">5. BIOLOGY! I\u2019ve always been interested in the science of living things, so biology has always been on the forefront of subjects that I enjoy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">6. I spent 10 weeks as an intern in the Neurosurgical department of a cancer research hospital in California\u2019s City of Hope. During the last two weeks of summer, I also traveled to Greece with my family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">7. Always having two built in friends no matter where you go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">8. This mainly pertains to my identical sister Joanna, but my least favorite part is being confused for her because there are some days I just don\u2019t feel like correcting people or just don\u2019t even acknowledge people who may be calling her name after me on the paths.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">9. It was helpful to go into prep year already knowing at least two people\u2014that\u2019s always a plus! But, regardless, it\u2019s been great to have them on campus because you know that if you need help on something or if you\u2019re just too stressed out to even function that they\u2019ll be there for you, ready to help or at least ready to commiserate right along with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Alex\u00a0Papadakis<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1. ESSO Youth Dance Ensemble, ESSO Pen pals, ESSO Just Keep Smiling <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">2. Black Raspberry with chocolate jimmies in a plain cone is my standard order, but I can go for mostly any flavor. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">3. Um \u2026 cookie monster for Lena? If that\u2019s even a thing &#8230; basically any flavor that you would have liked as a kid with a ton of random candy in it. And Joanna, maybe Rockie Road? <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">4. I\u2019m really enjoying the senior English Multigenre elective with Lundy Smith right now\u2014definitely up there as one of my favorites. But also Prep Bio with Mr. Matlack may take the cake. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">5. Spanish, because I think it is the most engaging and exciting class when discussion goes well. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">6. I worked at a Financial Software Company as their Recruiting Coordinator for most of the summer, but went to Greece to visit family for the last two weeks. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">7. Always having two of your best friends going through the same things as you\u2026 like college applications!!!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">8. The COMPETITION. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">9. They\u2019ve definitely made me smarter. Plus they\u2019re my own personal math tutors.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

Following a huge success last year, La Alianza Latina (LAL) decided to hold the dance another year. From 8 to 10 p.m., the Academy Center was transformed into a bubble popping with Latin American culture.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">La Alianza Latina, in conjunction with the Dean of Multicultural Affairs Rosanna Salcedo (LAL\u2019s adviser) organized the event. The group\u2019s members saw it fit to do so as this month is Latin Heritage Month. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Upper Jaynee Anaya said that the event was intended \u201cto appreciate the rich culture that Hispanic\/Latinx people bring to our campus.\u201d She believed it was successful in providing the Academy community with \u201ca little taste different types of music, foods, dialects and dances\u201d of Latin American and Spanish-speaking countries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cI know barely anything about Latin American culture, but one thing I did come to try was the food. It was actually really good.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Salcedo asked the band \u201cGrupo Fantasia,\u201d (featuring Angel Wagner) who performed last year, to perform again. The band described themselves as not merely a band but a \u201cmobile seminar on Latin American Heritage.\u201d Its members have perfected various styles of Latin American music such as merengue, salsa, cumbia, bachata and vallenato; that night, they shared their talent with the PEA community. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI didn\u2019t attend last year so I didn\u2019t know what to expect but it was quite a new experience,\u201d lower Ella Parsons said, speaking on the event as a whole. \u201cI can\u2019t say it\u2019s something I am used to but I will say that I enjoyed it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">From empanadas to churros, there was a greater variety of food this year as LAL tried to represent a wider range of culture within Latin America. \u201cI know barely anything about Latin American culture, but one thing I did come to try was the food. It was actually really good,\u201d lower Amelia Lee said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For people who didn\u2019t know how to dance to the songs, there were many students willing to help. \u201cI really didn\u2019t know what I was doing but Camilla helped me. I still couldn\u2019t get it but she tried to help at least,\u201d Lee said. However, lower Gabby Brown said, \u201cHonestly, I think it would\u2019ve been better if they taught us some more moves.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In general, the event was just as well received as the one last year. However, the location was a double-edged sword. Agora is a fairly central location that is heavily frequented, which would encourage people to drop by. On the other hand, it is quite small and didn&#8217;t leave a lot of space for people to move their bodies and get others there too. This is perhaps the reason for the lower turnout that Anaya mentions when recapping the night. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">All in all, the festival provided a familiar space for the Latin American community on campus to enjoy and share their culture with their peers as well as be \u201cin\u201d it despite the Exeter bubble. The rest of the community enjoyed it as a Saturday night event to pass the time, and perhaps, as intended by the organizers, a fun learning experience. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

        "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A cool breeze blew over the hillsides that flourished with autumn color as the Exeter girls\u2019 cross country team weaved through trails and climbed their way up the final hills of NMH\u2019s course. This was another banner week for GXC as they took home yet another win. Even though success seems constant at this point in their season, the team was sure to prepare thoroughly for the difficulties presented by NMH\u2019s course that they had not yet faced this season. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Juni Terry called NMH\u2019s course \u201cthe most difficult in the league.\u201d If you\u2019ve ever visited NMH, you will remember that it is a school atop a mountain, which is a recipe for a high difficulty race. Terry elaborated, \u201cExeter did really well at not being intimidated by NMH\u2019s course. We really pushed it on the hills. What makes their course so difficult is the countless hills from beginning to end.\u201d This rough terrain would be a challenge for any cross country runner, but it was especially so for Exeter due to the stark contrast to our very flat course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">&#8220;The course was full of hills and tough footing but everyone ran swiftly and had a great race.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Exeter spent a while training for these hills in practices and by going for a 10-mile team bonding hike last Saturday when there was no meet. This provided an opportunity for the team to get to know each other more closely, but also to be prepared for the mountainous challenge awaiting them at NMH. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior and co-captain Sarah Brown agreed that, \u201cthe course was full of hills and tough footing but everyone ran swiftly and had a great race.\u201d Brown also thought that what the course lacked in simplicity, it made up for in natural beauty. She said, \u201cThe course was very beautiful with amazing leaves and lots of woods.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lower Grace Gray echoed Brown\u2019s words, \u201cThe course was really beautiful and wide, and it was almost entirely rolling hills, which is different than our flat course at home, so it was challenging and really fun.\u201d Gray noticed that the opposing team did a particularly good job at mastering these hills and at maintaining a friendly, but competitive attitude. She added, \u201cI think that Exeter also did a good job of being friendly and respectful to NMH and then going out there on the course and working together to give it our best effort.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Thankfully, the week of intense training and preparation paid off. Exeter triumphed over NMH and beat them on their own turf. Brown noted, \u201cThe course ended with three hills. I saw many fast finishes on Exeter\u2019s part which were even more impressive after such a hard last half mile.\u201d The final score for varsity was 16-47 (in this sport, the lower the score the better), and 16-46 for JV. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Next week JV will face Brooks, and the following week both sections of the team will go against Deerfield Academy. The team hopes to see more fans on their sidelines, especially leading up to the big interscholastic race at E\/a that will be held here at home. Good luck to girls\u2019 cross country as they continue on their winning streak this season. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

The Early Life Decision application allows twelfth graders to write out a detailed description of the life they want, why they should get it, and whether or not their parents would be willing to donate a tennis court. If admitted, the applicant is then given the opportunity to either become a surgeon, marry and have 2.5 kids or become a lawyer, marry and have 2.5 kids.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI was nervous about applying Early Life Decision at first,\u201d stated senior and try-hard Megan Bell. \u201cFor awhile I couldn\u2019t decide which job my parents were forcing me into the most. After six more passive aggressive links to information about Harvard Law, I knew that my perfect life would involve a lot of reading and the potential to ruin others\u2019 lives.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Other seniors are facing similar stress during this time. \u201cI honestly do not think that I will get admitted into my Early Decision Life,\u201d said four-year and former prep spaz captain John Camp. \u201cI\u2019ve only been tri-var for two years, barely made it into early cum laude, once missed one of my nine ESSO clubs, and placed second nationally for table tennis.\u201d John Camp took a moment to sob. \u201cNow I realize that I just haven\u2019t done enough and that my future is wholly ruined.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Still, there are seniors that are already committed to a life. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that I\u2019ve been committed since birth,\u201d commented \u201917 member Ronald Trunt. Trunt, son of the wealthy businessman Ronald Trunt Sr., plans on continuing the family business and traveling to Europe every two weeks. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know that I am already committed, but I worked endlessly to get here.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The majority of seniors are not applying to Early Life Action. \u201cOh no, I totally respect all the Early Life Action life choices. I just personally want to steer clear of them,\u201d reported 12 anonymous sources.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As early decision and early action applications come to a close, seniors are able to spend their time otherwise. \u201cOnce I submit everything for my Early Life Decision,\u201d said Bell, \u201cI can finally get around to completing all of my regular applications.

        "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> After 25 years of dedicated work at the Academy, Executive Director of Alumni Relations and International Gifts Harold Brown will begin working at the Salisbury School. He served as the director of alumni affairs for most of his tenure and the director of alumni and parent relations for three years. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At the Salisbury School, Brown will be the director of development and responsible for supervision and oversight of all fundraising activities. \u201cFor many years it has been my desire to direct a fundraising operation,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When Brown graduated from Exeter in 1974, he did not have plans to work for the school. In his first 10 years as an alumnus, the only Exeter-related event he attended was his fifth reunion. In 1988, Wick Sloane \u201971 contacted Brown and requested he help organize a welcome dinner for Kendra O\u2019Donnell, Exeter\u2019s 12th principal, in Hartford, Conn. Shortly after, classmate David Henderson asked Brown to lead a fundraising project to paint a portrait of English instructor and admissions officer William Bolden, one of the first faculty members of color at the Academy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cMy time at Exeter, man and boy, has been an immeasurably transformative and rewarding experience\u2014all of it because of extraordinary people.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Brown became more involved with projects at and around Exeter, and eventually became an official staff member of the Academy. Recruited by classmate Linda Lanton, Brown participated in a program initiated by O\u2019Donnell to promote cultural diversity at Exeter. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This work led to an appointment on the Board of Directors of the General Alumni Association, and in 1991, Director of Development Jim Theisen recruited and O\u2019Donnell appointed Brown as the Director of Alumni Affairs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Brown\u2019s colleagues in the Office of Institutional Advancement described Brown as a kind and passionate leader and friend whom they will all miss seeing at work. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Christine Fell, the assistant to the Executive Director of Alumni Relations and International Gifts, worked alongside Brown for twenty years. She said that Brown always motivated others to embrace their potential because it made him happy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">She will miss hearing him encourage the Alumni Relations staff and say, \u201cThat lights me up.\u201d He created a friendly and humorous environment in Nathaniel Gilman House. Alumni Relations Program Manager Dawn Perkins said that in addition to the positive energy, thankfulness and goodness he provided, she will also miss his invaluable and knowledge of Academy history, names and events. Answering questions from <i>The Exonian<\/i> by email, Brown said he was thankful for the atmosphere in the office that his colleagues and close friends provided.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Assistant Director of Student and Young Alumni Programs Michelle Curtin worked for Brown for eight years, and she found his \u201cenergy, enthusiasm for work and his ability to always see the picture\u201d remarkable and qualities she will surely miss. \u201cHe has a huge heart and truly cares for the people he works with on both a professional and personal level,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Assistant Director of Alumni Relations Benita O\u2019Connell agreed with Curtin, saying that Brown\u2019s dedication to keeping the relationships of the alumni as his top priority exemplified an Alumni Relations professional. \u201cHe has been a joy to work with,\u201d she said. O\u2019Connell explained that while she will miss working with him in their office, everyone is very excited for him to have a new opportunity to share his talents with a different school and alumni network.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Curtin and O\u2019Connell were thankful that Brown, as an alum of Exeter, will remain a fundamental part of the school and cross paths in the future at events both on and off campus. \u201cAs an alumnus of PEA, he will continue to be involved and we look forward to having his support as a volunteer, again,\u201d O\u2019Connell said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Although Brown\u2019s role at the Academy was primarily involved with alumni communication, the students in Merrill Hall knew him as a supportive dorm affiliate since last year. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Yoshiko Lynch said that although she only knew him for one year, she felt that he was a brother because of his genuine kindness and care. \u201cI love having conversations with him because you can tell that he\u2019s really interested in what you have to say,\u201d she said. Lynch recalled a moment at the senior and alumni dinner when she felt awkward and alone, and once she saw Brown, she felt instant relief. \u201cHe came right up to me, hugged me and introduced me to these two [alumni] that I had a great conversation with,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When Brown was on duty on Tuesday nights, the students enjoyed listening to his stories and advice in the common room. Upper Jayleen Jaime explained that Brown became an integral part of Merrill and his storytelling on duty became a tradition.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>When dates arrived before Evening Prayer, Jaime explained that Brown would \u201ctake the role of the dad of Merrill\u201d and give their dates a hard time. He also provided Jaime with wise advice on getting through Exeter as a student of color.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Brown will miss all of the people he has become close to during his time at Exeter. \u201cMy time at Exeter, man and boy, has been an immeasurably transformative and rewarding experience\u2014all of it because of extraordinary people,\u201d he said. He acknowledged the impact of many of his former teachers and additional faculty whose \u201cwork and character have been mentors and role models\u201d for him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He said that he will miss witnessing and experiencing the \u201cimmense generosity that exists within the Exeter community\u201d after being involved with alumni relations at Exeter for 25 years. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He will also miss seeing the multitude of alumni and parents worldwide who have become closer through Exeter. \u201cIn all of this and even more, my Exeter experience has been a rich blessing for which I am and will forever be thankful,\u201d Brown said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Looking forward, Brown expressed excitement towards contributing to a different school in a new environment, with a similar mission. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe Salisbury School is an excellent school and aligns well with my values about secondary school education.\u201d he said. \u201cI am honored to have the opportunity to help advance its mission.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

        "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Exeter\u2019s Gender and Sexuality Alliance (GSA) worked to raise awareness of the LGBTQ+ community on National Coming<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Out Day, last Tuesday, Oct. 11. The day celebrates coming out as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, asexual, demi sexual or queer (LGBTQ+).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">GSA encouraged students to participate in the NOH8 campaign. NOH8 is a charitable organization that seeks to promote equality for LGBTQ+ individuals by photographing participants with \u201cNOH8\u201d written on the cheeks and silver duct tape across the mouth. GSA also asked the student body to show their support by wearing purple. Though wearing purple is associated with the celebration of Spirit Day, a day dedicated to combating the bullying directed towards members of the LGBTQ+ community, GSA coheads felt that wearing purple on Coming Out Day would make it even more impactful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">GSA also erected a door on the Academic Quad to represent those who have come out in the past and to welcome those who choose to come out in the future. In an email to club members, GSA coheads encouraged people to \u201cwalk through it and come out as whatever you want.\u201d The door also had a sign advertising GSA\u2019s Tuesday night meeting, where members and non-members alike could drop by to be photographed for the NOH8 Campaign.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Joanne Lembo, Director of Student Activities and adviser to GSA, hoped that these initiatives would help students understand that they have a \u201csafe place\u201d on campus. In the six years that GSA has put up the door on Coming Out Day, Lembo has seen interest steadily rise. Though she acknowledged that not everyone will feel comfortable enough to walk through it, she believed that it served a more \u201csymbolic\u201d purpose. In her opinion, the door represents the Academy\u2019s<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>recognition that not all will choose to go through it, but that it is there and it welcomes all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cNational Coming Out day is when I can look back and see how far I\u2019ve come in realizing my identity and accepting myself for who I am, unapologetically.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lower Miranda Derossi said she loved the door. \u201cI think it makes a statement and raises awareness for how important this day really is,\u201d she said. Lower Makinrola Orafidiya agreed and added that the door \u201cis really good for people who want to go through it and have it mean something to them.\u201d Comparing it to \u201creal-life clickbait,\u201d lower Emeline Scales commented on the magnetic quality of the door in drawing passersby to it. \u201cPeople will approach it, and although there will be people who make fun of it, it really does get the message out there to people who had no idea,\u201d Scales said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Grace Duisberg also liked the door, but, like Scales, saw that it could create opportunity for judgement from members of the community. \u201cI feel like people can be kind of judgmental and that makes people hesitant to use it,\u201d she observed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Responding to this concern, Dean of Multicultural Affairs Rosanna Salcedo pointed out that, for many people, fear of being judged prevents them from coming out as who they truly are. \u201cWe should be aware that there are people around us everyday who keep a part of who they are a secret, not because they want to, but because they fear prejudice, discrimination and even persecution,\u201d she said. Salcedo continued, describing this as \u201ca terrible burden to carry, a burden society inflicts on LGBTQ+ individuals unnecessarily.\u201d Salcedo also drew attention to the fears experienced by allies, noting that some people are afraid to be open about their support of LGBTQ+ individuals because of potential judgement from others. \u201cIf coming out as a supporter is difficult, imagine how hard it is for LGBTQ+ individuals to come out,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While Coming Out Day does not make coming out any less difficult, it offers a chance to celebrate the courage of those who have come out and welcomes those who are not yet ready to do so. Derossi saw it as \u201ca time to accept and love yourself, and to celebrate your sexual orientation, romantic orientation and gender identity, as well as a time for others to show their support.\u201d As Orafidiya pointed out, Coming Out Day can help people in the closet realize their identities or see that they are not alone. This rang true for Scales, who explained, \u201cNational Coming Out day is when I can look back and see how far I\u2019ve come in realizing my identity and accepting myself for who I am, unapologetically.\u201d Scales found it comforting to remind herself of how much she has grown over the past few years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For Salcedo, the day is an opportunity to reflect on LGBTQ+<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>individuals she knows and loves, and their coming out stories. \u201cWhile the journey was different for each of them, taking the step to live their life openly required tremendous courage,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom them I have learned the lesson of being true to oneself, and I am grateful for that.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">According to lower Adrian Venzon, a cohead of GSA, Coming Out Day removes some of the pressure that comes along with coming out \u201cbecause it\u2019s easy to see that you\u2019re not the only one.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, Venzon thought that Exeter could do a better job of celebrating it. Though a school-wide email was sent out detailing the events of the day and its importance, he felt that \u201cpeople didn\u2019t really take it to heart.\u201d Likewise, Duisberg questioned its effectiveness given that \u201ca fair number of people don\u2019t read the mass emails.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Duisburg also pointed out that wearing purple, though a good way to raise awareness, is only effective if \u201cwe all know what it means.\u201d Furthermore, Venzon expressed surprise at how few people actually wore purple on Tuesday. Derossi, too, noticed that not many students wore purple and those who did mostly belonged to GSA. \u201cI think it would be nice to have more campus-wide recognition of National Coming Out Day as a real and important celebration,\u201d she concluded.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Scales, however, felt that wearing purple and the NOH8 campaign were \u201ca wonderful way for allies or closeted LGBT members who don\u2019t feel comfortable coming to GSA to show support for LGBT.\u201d Since GSA began participating in the NOH8 campaign four years ago, Lembo has seen it gain popularity. \u201cPeople post on social media and it\u2019s an easy fun way of getting together,\u201d she said. For Derossi, \u201cthe NOH8 pictures are always fun and they have a powerful message,\u201d while Duisberg added that they are \u201ca fun way to bond in the community.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

        "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Very rarely is a director capable of creating so much sensation on screen with so little. And it\u2019s not physical sensation, but rather an enveloping visceral experience that is distinctly embedded in the nature of film. It is when a film leaps beyond the boundaries of logic, and pursues our primal senses and feelings through image and sound. Only the greatest, such as Stanley Kubrick and Andrei Tarkovsky, have achieved such daunting depths in filmmaking. It is this approach to filmmaking that drives the brilliance behind director\/animator Don Hertzfeldt\u2019s magnum opus \u201cIt\u2019s Such a Beautiful Day.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Watching \u201cIt\u2019s Such a Beautiful Day\u201d is an extremely bizarre and occasionally amusing experience. Stylistically, the film follows in the footsteps of Hertzfeldt\u2019s earlier short films, which contain an odd concoction of surrealism, idiosyncratic humor and minimalistic animation. However, on a narrative and thematic level, \u201cIt\u2019s Such a Beautiful Day\u201d distinguishes itself from those short films by reaching for something more profound. The film\u2019s core narrative is about a stick figure named Bill and the decline of his mental health. The film functions as an exploration of feelings and memories, and unfolds less as a cohesive story and more as a series of vignettes unified by Bill\u2019s struggles in life and impending death. Each scene ranges from the mundane to the absolute insane, both accomplished with equal believability. Even with such heavy subject matter, Hertzfeldt still maintains an absurd sense of humor, often communicated through his hilariously amateurish and monotonous narration.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt\u2019s Such a Beautiful Day\u201d is clearly the product of an auteur. The film\u2019s animation, sound design, special effects, narration and screenwriting were all completed by Hertzfeldt slaving away at his home. Despite this, the film still displays a remarkable level of inventiveness and technical sophistication. His animation style is distinctly characterized by stick figures and simple two-dimensional line drawings. If put in the hands of a lesser director\/animator, the film could have come off as childish and lazy, but Hertzfeldt manages to bring a renewed power to the style. After receiving the news of his terminal disease, there\u2019s a moment where Bill slowly takes off his hat and rubs his head. It\u2019s such a delicate moment that exemplifies the power of Hertzfeldt\u2019s simplicity. In order to display such an intimate level of rawness, the film must strip its visuals down to the bare bones of what makes us human.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Beyond the film\u2019s sequences of pen-and-paper animation, Hertzfeldt applies a wide palette of techniques. During Bill\u2019s hallucinations and daydreams, the film intersperses shots of distorted live-action with Douglas Trumbull-style special effects, reminiscent of Kubrick\u2019s \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d or Terrence Malick\u2019s \u201cThe Tree of Life.\u201d What really caught my attention was the film\u2019s use of sound. As in his previous films, Hertzfeldt loves to decorate blank frames with extremely lush and atmospheric sound. Sound effects, music and dialogue complement each other, and are sped up, slowed down, looped, panned from channel to channel and played backwards to create a cacophony of soundscapes. It is akin to the surreal and disturbing sound design of David Lynch\u2019s \u201cEraserhead.\u201d Hertzfeldt executes all of these techniques with such deliberation that it creates the perfect atmosphere for us to enter and experience the collapse of Bill\u2019s mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Ultimately, \u201cIt\u2019s Such a Beautiful Day\u201d is not just about Bill. It\u2019s about how there\u2019s a headstone waiting for all of us. Bill\u2019s failing mind is no different from our illogical and broken world, and his musings of daily life remind us that we are all struggling. The film\u2019s humor and raw animation style prevent these ideas from becoming pretentious and heavy-handed. Maybe that is why Bill\u2019s outlandish journeys evoke such strong emotion, because they describe on a deeply visceral and philosophical note what it means to be human. For what it\u2019s worth, we should appreciate our existence, even for all its craziness.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

        "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Over the course of the past year, <i>The Boston Globe\u2019s <\/i>spotlight team has published a series of articles on cases of sexual misconduct at Exeter, a part of a larger series covering this issue at boarding and private day schools across New England. Since the articles\u2019 publication, some members of the PEA community have expressed concern and frustration at a bias they see in <i>The Globe\u2019s<\/i> writing. Despite criticism of the press coverage, the administration and members of the community have taken steps in the past three months to raise awareness about consent and sexual assault on campus. The school has made numerous administrative changes and hired outside investigators. Some alumni have threatened to withhold financial support. Two student organizations, Exonians Against Sexual Assault and <i>MVMENT Magazine<\/i>, were established to address sexual misconduct on campus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Scott Allen, Spotlight team editor at <i>The Boston Globe<\/i>, explained that his team began to cover sexual misconduct at private schools last year after one of their reporters, Bella English, exposed years of previously unreported sexual abuse at St. George\u2019s School in Rhode Island. They began to look at reports of sexual misconduct at private and parochial schools across New England, and found that their investigations yielded surprisingly fruitful results. \u201cFrankly, we found a lot more allegations than we expected,\u201d Allen said. \u201cIncluding many that had never been made public and involved current teachers.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cWe do everything in our power to contact people who represent all perspectives in controversial incidents such as sexual misconduct allegations.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">English instructor Becky Moore said that what she has observed at Exeter regarding its handling of sexual misconduct cases does not fully align with what the <i>Globe<\/i> has reported. \u201cIn the case of the recent <i>Globe<\/i> articles about PEA, I know enough about the integrity of the colleagues mentioned to know that there must be more information that has not been made available to the media for reasons of student privacy or school litigation,\u201d she said. \u201cI am close enough to the institutional community to know of the complexities that I do not think have been fully represented in the stories.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In addition, Health instructor Michelle Soucy feared that<i> The Globe<\/i> had not taken necessary precautions to prevent negative consequences as a result of the publication of the articles. \u201c[<i>The Globe<\/i>] was a little too specific with some of the cases, which made it easy for members of our community to figure out who the people were,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that was a mistake.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In spite of these accusations, Allen reported that the Spotlight team of reporters at <i>The Globe<\/i> have worked hard throughout their coverage of these sexual misconduct cases to ensure that they are hearing from a broad variety of people. \u201cWe talked to scores and scores of people to produce our stories on sexual misconduct, including alleged victims, witnesses, lawyers, teachers, school officials and others,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWe do everything in our power to contact people who represent all perspectives in controversial incidents such as sexual misconduct allegations.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In addition, reporters sought documentation in as many cases as possible, looking for evidence ranging from lawsuits to police reports to school disciplinary proceedings. \u201cWe look for corroborating evidence of every claim,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWe also seek out contemporaneous documentation such as police reports or email that are sometimes more authoritative than people\u2019s memories after the fact.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Allen described the investigative process <i>The Globe<\/i> took for the July 2016 article they published, which revealed Exeter\u2019s alleged mishandling of a recent sexual misconduct case at Exeter involving two students from the class of 2016.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>As well as interviewing the complainant, <i>The Globe<\/i> acquired emails from Reverend Robert H. Thompson, in which he said that the respondent expressed his regret and took responsibility for what he had done. They also acquired emails from Dean Melissa Mischke, which provided the school\u2019s view on what happened after a school investigator interviewed him. \u201cOur story about [the respondent] did not rely solely on [the complainant\u2019s] perspective,\u201d Allen said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Mischke declined to comment. Members of the administration are unable to comment at this time due to ongoing legal investigations into cases of sexual misconduct involving the Academy.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>\u201cThe specific situation you are inquiring about is in the hands of law enforcement, and therefore the school administration will not be sharing any additional information,\u201d Principal MacFarlane said, in a Sept. 8 interview with <i>The Exonian<\/i>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Although the administration cannot comment on the cases covered by <i>The Globe<\/i> articles at this time, they have taken steps to address the issues raised. The academy has made revisions to the E-Book, hired two interim directors of student wellbeing, Tina Sciocchetti and Jane Stapleton, had faculty receive boundary training, updated the faculty handbook and code of conduct, published a Sexual Misconduct Prevention and Response Action Plan, and has hired lawyers and consultants to review current policies and past cases of misconduct. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Nevertheless, Allen acknowledged that his team of reporters were not always able to incorporate the voices of every person involved, sometimes for reasons out of his control. \u201cWe also reached out to [the other student], members of his family and his attorney to give them an opportunity to comment,\u201d he said. \u201cThey declined.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He went on, explaining that the Spotlight team approached the story with particular care because of the youth of the involved parties. \u201cWe worked to make sure [the students\u2019 attorneys] understood fully the nature of our story,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end, we felt it was an important story to tell since it provided an inside look at how one of the nation\u2019s leading private schools handled a recent sexual misconduct complaint.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Bonnie LaBont\u00e9 thought <i>The Globe<\/i> should have taken more steps to ensure that all parties were accurately represented. \u201cPerhaps <i>The Boston Globe<\/i> could have had facts confirmed and also examined both sides of the story to give a clearer understanding of what happened,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Tayo Zenger felt that bias was inherent in articles on complex issues like sexual misconduct. \u201cDon\u2019t believe everything you read,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it comes to articles regarding sexual misconduct, in my opinion, we will never know the complete story.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">History instructor Michael Golay said the school itself may have had reasons for not talking directly to <i>The Globe<\/i>, but he understood why it would then make sense for the newspaper to move forward with the piece. \u201cThe school maintains its valid reasons about why it can\u2019t be candid about these cases,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a newspaper waited for powerful institutions to talk to them when it was convenient for the institutions, nothing would ever get reported.\u201d LaBont\u00e9 questioned the papers\u2019 motives in the long-term coverage of this issue at private schools, and why few articles have been published about public school cases. \u201cI think <i>The Boston Globe<\/i> loves to see rich people behaving poorly,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd sometimes they exploit the stories for their own benefit.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Allen explained that, though sexual misconduct at public schools is undoubtedly an issue, the Spotlight team has been focused on addressing the symptoms of sexual abuse particular to private schools because of their environments. \u201cWe have tried to be clear throughout that there is no evidence that sexual misconduct is more prevalent at private schools than public ones,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, child advocates have said that the boarding school setting creates unique opportunities for abuse.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For Allen and the rest of the Spotlight team, their recent coverage of boarding school sexual misconduct has given them the opportunity to write about what they believe is an important and relevant issue. \u201cToday\u2019s students are our future and the public is right to be concerned about their safety and wellbeing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe talked to many past victims of sexual abuse in school who were still traumatized many decades after their teachers took advantage of their trust and their innocence.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Golay said the work <i>The Globe<\/i> had done was solid and as thorough as it could have been, given the circumstances of confidentiality. \u201c<i>The Globe<\/i> has done service to us and to other schools by focusing on this issue and doing what I consider to be pretty sophisticated, very substantial reporting on an issue that should interest all of us,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Allen emphasized the importance of bringing the topic matter covered in <i>The Globe<\/i> series to light. \u201cIt\u2019s a clich\u00e9, but it\u2019s true: today\u2019s students are our future and the public is right to be concerned about their safety and wellbeing,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">LaBont\u00e9 agreed with Allen, despite her misgivings about the biased nature of <i>The Globe\u2019s<\/i> reporting. \u201cThe stories seem one sided and exaggerated, but they bring attention to problems of our past and start discussion,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Upper Chiara Perotti Correa said that she, too, found the reporting to be an important piece that helped to instigate change on campus. Correa highlighted the detriments as well as the benefits of <i>The Globe\u2019s<\/i> reporting. \u201cIt has brought up awareness,\u201d she said. \u201cBut at the same time, it has damaged the lives of people involved.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Allen said he hoped <i>The Globe\u2019s<\/i> reporting has opened up discussion and change across the country.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe are extremely grateful that our stories have forced a national conversation about sexual misconduct in private schools, a conversation that was long overdue,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

        "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Six students provided their experiences as people of color on campus at Tuesday\u2019s assembly, narrating personal stories in an attempt to illuminate possible areas of improvement for Exeter. Senior Livaslou Tanjong began planning the assembly last year because she felt like conversations about race had dwindled. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Tanjong solicited short essays from six students of color to discuss their experiences and difficulties they regularly face as minorities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Upper Christian Flores delivered the first speech of the assembly, focusing on his family and his upbringing. He contrasted his father, a bus driver, and his mother, a public school teacher assistant, to businessmen and professors, professions he considered typical of many Exeter parents. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He explained what it is like for him to have parents who are not fluent in English, and how his family is often stared at while speaking Spanish in public. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Initially, he didn\u2019t want to speak because he thought he was expected to represent the Latinx community as a whole. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cBut then I was told to talk about myself, I felt more enthusiastic because I felt as though I wasn\u2019t bound to anyone or any community and could talk about my own personal experience,\u201d Flores said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Nada Zohayr spoke about both her and her mothers\u2019 experiences as women of color. She expressed concerns about POC allies using the issue of race as a platform to push their own agendas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">\u201cIt\u2019s like being invited to the dinner table party but you\u2019re not making me a place at the table, so I have to make my own place at that table.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">She drew parallels between her mother\u2019s experience and her own, describing Exeter as a place that was not built for the success of people of color, but rather \u201cProtestant white boys.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">She expressed what it\u2019s like for her to attend Exeter with an analogy. \u201cIt\u2019s like being invited to the dinner table party but you\u2019re not making me a place at the table, so I have to make my own place at that table.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">After Zohayr, lower Adrian Venzon spoke about his experience as a gay Asian American on campus. While hesitant about speaking about the \u201ctouchy subject\u201d of race at first, he eventually decided to accept Tanjong\u2019s offer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As a co-head of Gender and Sexuality Alliance (GSA) and a member of the Asian Advisory Board, he felt it was his duty to speak about his identity. He said he hoped the assembly will open up opportunities to talk about race, which he doesn\u2019t normally discuss regularly with his friends.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In his speech, Venzon touched upon some of the issues Asian Americans face. Although he admitted that before coming to Exeter he was not aware of these issues and never saw himself as being part of a minority, he recalled an Exonian Encounter meeting when he first realized that most Asians are portrayed poorly, or not at all, in movies and television. He also has come face to face with the model minority myth while on campus. \u201cI still hear things like \u2018Asians are so good at math,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cOne, I\u2019m not that good at math, and two, if I was, it wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with me being Asian.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Leena Hamad spoke about her experience identifying as Sudanese, African, Muslim, Arab and American. She told stories about her identities being trivialized and misunderstood. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Hamad said she is constantly misidentified and questioned about where she is from, and felt concerned that conversations around race seem to have dissipated. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt\u2019s something that needs to be talked about, and when we do talk about it usually it\u2019s very politicized, but we don\u2019t really get into the personal aspects of race,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Senior Kelvin Green II told stories about his growth as a POC at Exeter, such as his experience listening to other students of color speak on Friday nights at Afro-Latino Exonian Society (ALES). He then spoke about the importance of supporting the \u201cyouth from every quarter\u201d that makes up the student body, not only by adding another black faculty member. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He also expressed how lucky he is to be at a school where he can speak freely about racial issues to a community that cares.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Tanjong, the final speaker, hoped that hers and others\u2019 words will encourage students to speak up, voice their questions and support their peers. She also urges people to attend events and club meetings to show their support for POC as well as to educate themselves on one of today\u2019s most common, yet most misunderstood issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Tanjong ended the assembly with insight into her life as a member of a minority group saying, \u201cbeing black at Exeter means speaking in a conversation to which you are the only participant. It means that in spite of offering my voice, I am often met by your silences. Race is the awkward topic that no one wants to broach.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Dean of Multicultural Affairs Rosanna Salcedo felt that it is important for students of color to have the opportunity to vocalize their concerns, which otherwise can be overlooked and go unheard. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">She believed that it is difficult to have discussions regarding issues of diversity and equity because they are often seen as \u201csecondary to academic subjects, lacking in intellectual value and otherwise unimportant.\u201d She said this disadvantages everyone because it prevents progression in the community.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe most important thing we can do to support students and faculty of color is improve our social consciousness,\u201d Salcedo said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cGreater consciousness about these issues would hopefully inspire a sense of individual and collective responsibility to address inequities when we witness them.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Mathematics instructor and ALES adviser Sami Atif felt that the assembly was effective because it gave \u201cvoices to the voiceless\u201d and put a \u201cspotlight\u201d on bystanders. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In light of the campaign season, he hopes that the class of 2017 does not graduate \u201cless equipped\u201d than preceding classes to discuss race and its intricate implications in every community. \u201cMiseducation about differences is a threat to the nation,\u201d he said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Atif also felt that although the \u201ctraditionally, exclusively white male\u201d faculty has made progress, especially with the extensive electives offered, the curriculum is still a challenge for POC on campus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cA difficulty I hear too often from students of color is that of injury around the table,\u201d Atif said. \u201cAdults and students alike who are willfully ignorant about others in their midst and under their care.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Several students were glad that the assembly started a conversation about race on campus. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Upper Charlotte Polk, a co-head of ALES, thought senior Kelvin Green II made a strong point when he explained how diversity is also about understanding different perspectives. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, she said the Academy still has a long way to go. \u201cI think [further] diversity training for faculty would really push us further as a diverse prep school,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Prep Janalie Cobb agreed. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great step in the right direction, but there is still more that the administration needs to do to improve,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Prep Eman Noraga appreciated that Tanjong talked about discrimination and harassment of girls who wear hijabs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cAs one of the only hijabi students on campus, it was nice to hear about me for once because not a lot of people talk about issues pertaining to us,\u201d she said, \u201cand it made me realize I don\u2019t necessarily need to have the same race or religion, but I still go through the same stuff they do.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

        "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I\u2019<\/span><span class=\"s1\">m sure I\u2019m not the first person you\u2019ve heard to complain about America\u2019s broken food system. In the last decade, people have become more aware of the issues surrounding food insecurity in America, and we have begun to see more promoters of honest and quality cuisine in our lives. This is new, my friends. The movement has appropriately been dubbed the \u201cGood Food Revolution.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">&#8220;Food is what brings us together, but right now we are letting it rip us apart.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I grew up surrounded by food-lovers. My dad cooks for a living, we rarely shop at the grocery store and we practically live on a farm. The community of rural Berwick, Maine is so unlike anywhere else. By nature rather than force, we are committed to supporting the roots of our food system and eating as directly from the source as we can. It is not only a respectful way to live but also far more healthier for our bodies and relationships. Instead, our country thrives on a food system that is not supportive of its farmers, on food with degraded quality for reduced monetary value and that consequentially leaves the second largest carbon footprint of any country in the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Carbon footprint plays a large role in my dissatisfaction with our current food system. It is deeply disturbing to me that squid caught in Rhode Island must be frozen, packaged and sent to China where it is thawed, processed, refrozen and repackaged, before it is shipped back to the same Rhode Island port to be sold. It is wrong that a mushroom farmer must drive his mushrooms from New Hampshire to Northern Vermont to be inspected, then to Massachusetts to be packaged, in order to legally sell them to his own neighbor. We need to be much more critical. We must question our daily practices, question the rules and regulations put upon us. The fashion in which we raise and deliver our food is not only downright disgusting when thinking about the number of states and countries our food has touched before it reaches our own plates, but also directly plays a role in the grander issue of global climate change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">We need to be wiser when talking about how to solve climate change. Let\u2019s begin to be skeptical of how our every intake and action is affecting the planet. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">What would I like to see change? The people have the power to reform their culture and the legislature that defines it. It\u2019s about time that the problems with America\u2019s food system enter the national spotlight. I would like food insecurity and carbon footprint to be a talking point of the presidential candidates and other politicians from both parties. A legislative reform around food policy would greatly impact our personal health and the health of our planet. The first step is simply realizing the urgency and relevance of this issue. It is something we all contribute to, whether or not we realize it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Food is more than nourishment, and it is surely more than money. Food is connection, tradition and family. It is the practice of people primitively relying on each other, something we desperately need in a world of technology and interpersonal distance. Food is what brings us together, but right now we are letting it rip us apart. Next time you take a fork to hand, please take these thoughts to heart. <\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

        "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Recently, Congress overrode President Obama\u2019s veto on a bill that would allow the families of those killed in 9\/11 to sue Saudi Arabia and other sponsors of international terrorism for their presumed role in the attacks. Though I honor these families for their desire to seek justice for their relatives, the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act makes the U.S. more vulnerable in the global arena and undermines our relations with a strategic ally in the Middle East.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">&#8220;Strong diplomatic relations are crucial if we aim to rid the region of its volatility and extremist tendencies.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">As Americans, we pride ourselves in the prestige we carry on the international stage and refuse to confess to our neocolonialist ambitions. The truth is that the U.S. has spurred turmoil and violence across many countries in its efforts to subject them to its vision of government. U.S. interventions in Latin America have resulted in brutal dictatorships and civil unrest. In the 1930s, Franklin Delano Roosevelt helped to install Anastasio Somoza Garc\u00eda as the president of Nicaragua, and then manipulated him to secure U.S. interests. In the 1950s, the United States overthrew the president of Guatemala Jacobo Arbenz to prevent the implementation of a land reform that would endanger American fruit companies. In other cases, the implications of our foreign policy decisions are less noticeable but nevertheless destructive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Before we accuse other countries for their wrongdoings, we must ask ourselves the question: Are we willing to tolerate and fight against reciprocal accusations? Politicians eagerly sign deals that benefit their polling in the short-term without considering long-term repercussions. In March 2002, President George W. Bush imposed tariffs on imported steel to gain support from the steel industries of Pennsylvania, a battleground state. Although Bush intended the tariff to last three years, he cut it thirteen months short when the European Union retaliated with tariffs on American exports from other swing states like Florida. Bush learned that politics can be a zero-sum game. The 9\/11 bill will empower other countries to sue the United States in international courts and seek concessions from our government on major foreign policy issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Indeed, Saudi Arabia has become more erratic and self-centered in the past few years. Its leaders have committed atrocious human rights violations and kept oil prices down in OPEC. Together, with other Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia has nurtured religious extremism in moderate Muslim countries like Bosnia and Albania, promoting a harsh Wahhabi version of Islam. During the Arab Spring, it suppressed rebellion and disturbed the already fragile political systems in Middle Eastern countries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Despite Saudi Arabia\u2019s repugnant actions, the United States should strive to maintain an appropriate relation with the country, given its large supply of crude oil and strategic position on the Arabian Peninsula. Strong diplomatic relations are crucial if we aim to rid the region of its volatility and extremist tendencies. Saudi Arabia has fought against ISIL on many occasions and has taken steps to prevent Saudis from traveling abroad to Iraq. The United States and Saudi Arabia see eye to eye on most methods of counterterrorism, so we should strive to nurture our cooperation on those issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">I believe that JASTA will provoke a myriad of unintended implications. I acknowledge that King Salman does not share the United States\u2019 vision of democracy and human rights, but question whether confrontation with the Saudi monarchy will further our long-term goal of stability in the Middle East or encourage Saudi Arabia to confess to its involvement in 9\/11 attacks. More importantly, JASTA sets a dangerous precedent for international legal institutions by motivating other countries to sue the United States.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

        "content": "<p class=\"p1\">From allegations of indecency to threatening to take their rival as a political prisoner, the second presidential debate on Sunday was a reminder that we are still living inside a reality show even more terrifying than Toddlers &amp; Tiaras. The candidates sparred over important questions that will determine the fate of our country, such as \u201cWas it 39 or 35 thousand emails?\u201d and \u201cWas it really a good idea for Anderson Cooper to wear those glasses?\u201d Donald Trump, the designated racist old guy in this election cycle, outsourced American visions of democracy to countries like the Russian Federation and the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. In a single run-on sentence that lasted just over two minutes Trump managed to describe in detail how he\u2019d imprison Clinton. Clinton brushed off the comments, joking that she \u201cwouldn\u2019t be the only one in orange.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Trump also attempted to emasculate Clinton by inviting four women who claimed to have been assaulted by her husband, Former President and part-time saxophonist Bill Clinton. \u201cLook at your women. They are all fours. Maybe the one on the far right is a five on a good day,\u201d said Trump, completely oblivious to the concept of basic human decency. \u201cBelieve me, I have the best women, tremendous women.\u201d Trump pointed to his wife Melania and his daughter Ivanka. When asked by the moderators if he was confusing Clinton with her husband, Trump said \u201cI tell it like it is,\u201d and promptly went on a tangent about how Douglas MacArthur would defeat ISIS.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Amidst all the Trump insanity, from calling Clinton the devil to periodically creeping up behind her as he sniffed discreetly, the most shocking event of the evening was not from either candidate. The biggest turn of events was the final question, asked by undecided voter Paul Ryan, a trembling Wisconsin man with wide blue eyes. Shaking as he held the microphone, Ryan asked both candidates \u201cCan each of you say something positive about Donald Trump?\u201d Trump responded with an incoherent monologue bragging about his accomplishments, including but not limited to how he \u201cdestroyed\u201d Rosie O\u2019Donnell and the fact that his fingers are in fact slender, beautiful, and proportional to his body and that he even grew them himself. The undecided voter\u2019s hands shook as he frantically took note of Trump\u2019s words on a yellow legal pad. Clinton, more succinct in her response, told the audience that Trump is \u201cawfully good at handing over elections.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">At press time, Hillary Clinton was leading Donald Trump by 14 points one on one, and leading by 11 points when including third party candidates Gary Johnson, Jill Stein, and Kenneth Bone.<\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",

The very morning after that debate, Mr. Trump went straight to the press, griping about how the moderator (Mr. Lester Holt of NBC) was biased and even complaining about a supposedly broken microphone and trying to make excuses for his lackluster performance. During the second debate the other night, Mr. Trump again failed to exhibit decorum or politeness towards his opponent and acted as he was expected to\u2014with no grace whatsoever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 pullquote\">&#8220;I have a fear that these political debates will become less and less about explaining policies and showing grit. As we see now, they appear to be merely transforming into a mudslinging popularity contest.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Debates are a chance to show people what candidates are really made of. Not only do they allow potential presidents to express their opinions and ideas, but they also show how they act under pressure. After all, it is tough to get hard questions thrown at you with only two minutes to answer. Debates can change the entire forecast of an election within minutes. However, one could argue that conduct at the podium is more important than what the candidates have to say and could especially argue that it makes or breaks would-be presidential careers.When faced with a loss, I was always taught to be a good sport. My parents told me that it doesn\u2019t matter if you win or lose; it\u2019s how you play the game. I have lived with this philosophy throughout my life. Whether I was playing little league baseball or was participating in a tennis tournament, I was always told to be gracious in victory and even more so in defeat. I had first hand experience with those poor sports who chose not to embody this belief. In the end, those who failed to be courteous to their opponents looked dumb and immature. This general idea of the \u201cGolden Rule\u201d applies just as much to presidential debates.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Even when Mr. Trump spoke at primary Republican debates, whether he won or lost, he always had one go-to excuse at the ready. \u201cIt was rigged.\u201d Excuse me? Saying this wasn\u2019t only childish; it was inexcusably rude to his opponents. In doing so during the primaries, he sought to invalidate them and make their victory less meaningful. A person who cannot acknowledge their own shortcomings or who always has to blame someone else for bad things that transpire in their life is not at all fit to be president. What Mr. Trump needs is some self awareness, and even more importantly, he needs accountability for his mistakes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">However, this \u201cblame others for my errors\u201d mindset is only one aspect of his lack of sportsmanship. During both the debates, we saw both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump were more than happy to interrupt one another\u2014yet one much more so than the other. During the first debate in particular, Mrs. Clinton interrupted Mr. Trump 17 times while Mr. Trump interrupted Mrs. Clinton a whopping 51 times. Just to put this in perspective, during the second debate of the last presidential race (the so-called \u201cInterruption Debate\u201d on October 16, 2012), Mr. Mitt Romney interrupted Mr. Obama 28 times and Mr. Obama interrupted Mr. Romney 36 times. This was considered by many at the time to be appalling and unprecedented, but even these staggering figures pale in comparison to Mr. Trump\u2019s 51 interruptions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Now, what does this tell us about him? It proves even more so that he doesn\u2019t know how to respectfully and actively listen while at the same time showing that he prefers hearing himself over others. On a more important note, is that really how we want a president to behave? At Exeter, one of the first things we were taught as new students was to let the other person voice their opinion first and wait your turn to talk (which, believe it or not, works and makes for great conversations). On top of this, we were taught to never interrupt somebody in the middle of speaking. Without these basic rules, our Harkness classes would fail to be. Unfortunately for him, Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t get this basic human concept of politeness and etiquette and perhaps never will.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">I have a fear that these political debates will become less and less about explaining policies and showing grit. As we see now, they appear to be merely transforming into a mudslinging popularity contest. Looking far, far ahead to the 2020 presidential election, one can only hope that both candidates will exhibit decorum and civility during bitter debates.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"display: block !important; margin:0 !important; padding: 0 !important\" id=\"wpp_popup_post_end_element\"><\/div>",
