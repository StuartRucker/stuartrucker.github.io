        <h4>My research is currently funded by NIH grants.</h4>
        <p>My research covers several broad areas in statistics genetics,genomics and metagenomics: methods for mapping genes for complex diseases, methods for integrative analysis of genomic data and methods for microbiome and metagenomics. From 1998 to 2012, I was supported by an NIH R01 grant (ES009911) to develoop methods for mapping genes for complex diseases, including methods for linkage, association, haplotype and admixture mapping. My method research on genomic data analysis was supported by a NIH R01 grant, focusing on developing statistical and computational methods for analysis of genomic data with graphical structure, and another R01 grant focusing on analysis of next generation sequencing data. I was also the PI of a T-32 traininng grant "Training in Ophthalmic Statistical Genetics and Bioinformatics" to train investigators in the area of statistical genetics for ophthalmic genetics.</p>
        <p>My current research focuses on statistical and computational issues related to analysis of microbiome and metagenomics data. I have one R01 grant in this area to develop computational methods for analysis of microbiome and metagenomics data.</p>
        <p>I also collaborate with Penn investigators on genetic and genomics studies of complex diseases and biological systems. My most recent collaborations are in the area of microbiome and its association with diseases such as IBD, obesity and cancer.</p>
